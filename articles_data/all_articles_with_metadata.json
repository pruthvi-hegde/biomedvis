    "abstract": "Pediatric brain tumor radiotherapy research is investigating how radiation influences the development and function of a patient's brain. To better understand how brain growth is affected by the treatment, the brain structures of the patient need to be explored and analyzed pre- and post-treatment. In this way, anatomical changes are observed over a long period and are assessed as potential early markers of cognitive or functional damage. In this early work, we propose an automated approach for the visual assessment of the growth prediction of brain structures in pediatric brain tumor radiotherapy patients. Our approach reduces the need for re-segmentation and the time required for it. We employ as a basis pre-treatment Computed Tomography (CT) scans with manual delineations (i.e., segmentation masks) of specific brain structures of interest. These pre-treatment masks are used as initialization, to predict the corresponding masks on multiple post-treatment follow-up Magnetic Resonance (MR) images, using an active contour model approach. For the accuracy quantification of the automatically predicted posttreatment masks, a support vector regressor (SVR) with features related to geometry, intensity, and gradients is trained on the pre-treatment data. Finally, a distance transform is employed to calculate the distances between pre- and post-treatment data and to visualize the predicted growth of a brain structure, along with its respective accuracy. Although segmentations of larger structures are more accurately predicted, the growth behavior of all structures is learned correctly, as indicated by the SVR results. This suggests that our pipeline is a positive initial step for the visual assessment of brain structure growth prediction."

    "abstract": "Several diagnostic and treatment procedures require the segmentation of anatomical structures from medical images. However, the automatic model-based methods that are often employed, may produce inaccurate segmentations. These, if used as input for diagnosis or treatment, can have detrimental effects for the patients. Currently, an analysis to predict which anatomic regions are more prone to inaccuracies, and to determine how to improve segmentation algorithms, cannot be performed. We propose a visual tool to enable experts, working on model-based segmentation algorithms, to explore and analyze the outcomes and errors of their methods. Our approach supports the exploration of errors in a cohort of pelvic organ segmentations, where the performance of an algorithm can be assessed. Also, it enables the detailed exploration and assessment of segmentation errors, in individual subjects. To the best of our knowledge, there is no other tool with comparable functionality. A usage scenario is employed to explore and illustrate the capabilities of our visual tool. To further assess the value of the proposed tool, we performed an evaluation with five segmentation experts. The evaluation participants confirmed the potential of the tool in providing new insight into their data and employed algorithms. They also gave feedback for future improvements."

    "abstract": "Molecular surfaces are a commonly used representation in the analysis of molecular structures as they provide a compact description of the space occupied by a molecule and its accessibility. However, due to the high abstraction of the atomic data, fine grain features are hard to identify. Moreover, these representations involve a high degree of occlusions, which prevents the identification of internal features and potentially impacts shape perception. In this paper, we present a set of techniques which are inspired by the properties of translucent materials, that have been developed to improve the perception of molecular surfaces: First, we introduce an interactive algorithm to simulate subsurface scattering for molecular surfaces, in order to improve the thickness perception of the molecule. Second, we present a technique to visualize structures just beneath the surface, by still conveying relevant depth information. And lastly, we introduce reflections and refractions into our visualization that improve the shape perception of molecular surfaces. We evaluate the benefits of these methods through crowd-sourced user studies as well as the feedback from several domain experts."

    "abstract": "Intraoperative ultrasound (iUS) imaging supports neurosurgeons significantly during brain tumor operations. At the beginning of the intervention the integration of the iUS image data within the navigation system guides the surgeon by optimally planning the position and size of the skull opening. After tumor resection, the visualization of the iUS image data enables to identify possible tumor residuals. However, the iUS image data can be complex to interpret. Existing segmentation and registration functions were assembled into pipeline to enhance brain tumor contours in the 3D iUS image data. A brain tumor model, semi-automatically segmented in the preoperative MR data of patients, is rigidly registered with the 3D iUS image using image gradient information. The contour of the registered tumor model is visualized on the monitor of the navigation system. The rigid registration step was offline evaluated on 15 patients who overcame a brain tumor operation. The registered tumor models were compared with manual segmentations of the brain tumor in the 3D iUS data. Averaged DSI values of 82.3% and 68.4% and averaged contour mean distances of 1.7 mm and 3.3 mm were obtained for brain metastases and glioblastomas respectively. Future works will include the improvement of the functions in the pipeline, the integration of the pipeline into a centralized assistance system including further fonctionalities and connected with the navigation system, and the evaluation of the system during brain tumor operations."

    "abstract": "Identification and counting of cells and mitotic figures is a standard task in diagnostic histopathology. Due to the large overall cell count on histological slides and the potential sparse prevalence of some relevant cell types or mitotic figures, retrieving annotation data for sufficient statistics is a tedious task and prone to a significant error in assessment. Automatic classification and segmentation is a classic task in digital pathology, yet it is not solved to a sufficient degree. We present a novel approach for cell and mitotic figure classification, based on a deep convolutional network with an incorporated Spatial Transformer Network. The network was trained on a novel data set with ten thousand mitotic figures, about ten times more than previous data sets. The algorithm is able to derive the cell class (mitotic tumor cells, non-mitotic tumor cells and granulocytes) and their position within an image. The mean accuracy of the algorithm in a five-fold cross-validation is 91.45 %. In our view, the approach is a promising step into the direction of a more objective and accurate, semi-automatized mitosis counting supporting the pathologist."

    "abstract": "Image guidance of medical procedures may use thermal images to monitor a treatment. Analysis of the thermal images by the physician may be time consuming and confusing because the thermal image includes multiple outliers. We present a novel inlier detection method for thermal images that results in reliable thermal information to support medical decision making. Outliers in thermal images are particularly challenging to detect using conventional methods, because they are significantly more abundant than inliers and, like inliers, they may be temporally consistent. Our inlier detection method is physically-based: it is motivated by the fact that heat propagation in soft tissues can be modeled using the bio-heat equation. Pixels are classified as inliers only if the temperature pattern in a spatial and temporal neighborhood strongly correlates with the physical model. For improved robustness, the correlation process includes a 2D filter in the spatial domain and a 3D filter in both spatial and temporal domains. Experiments with real data have shown that our method produces results that agree with annotations provided by human experts even in outlier-laden images. Our results show inliers can be detected leaving true heat pixels for the physician to observe, while not overloading him with the need to analyze outliers. The technique has been integrated in a true clinical environment and is being used to aid physicians in analysis of thermal images"

    "abstract": "CFD simulations are an increasingly important method for the non-invasive analysis of risk factors for aneurysm rupture. Their robustness, however, has to be examined more thoroughly before clinical use is possible. We present a novel framework that enables robustness evaluation of CFD simulation according to mesh deformation on patient-specific blood vessel geometry. Our tool offers a guided workflow to generate, run, and visualize OpenFOAM simulations, which significantly decreases the usual overhead of CFD simulations with OpenFOAM. Besides, the deformation of the original geometry allows the user to evaluate the robustness of the simulation without the need to repeat expensive operations of the data pre-processing phase. We assessed the robustness of CFD simulations by applying our framework to several aneurysm data sets."

    "abstract": "The exploration of time-dependent measured or simulated blood flow is challenging due to the complex three-dimensional structure of vessels and blood flow patterns. Especially on a 2D screen, understanding their full shape and interacting with them is difficult. Critical regions do not always stand out in the visualization and may easily be missed without proper interaction and filtering techniques. The FlowLens [GNBP11] was introduced as a focus-and-context technique to explore one specific blood flow parameter in the context of other parameters for the purpose of treatment planning. With the recent availability of affordable VR glasses it is possible to adapt the concepts of the FlowLens into immersive VR and make them available to a broader group of users. Translating the concept of the Flow Lens to VR leads to a number of design decisions not only based around what functions to include, but also how they can be made available to the user. In this paper, we present a configurable focus-and-context visualization for the use with virtual reality headsets and controllers that allows users to freely explore blood flow data within a VR environment. The advantage of such a solution is the improved perception of the complex spatial structures that results from being surrounded by them instead of observing through a small screen."

    "abstract": "Residual stress is the stress which remains in a deformable body in the absence of external forces. Due to the release of residual stress after cutting, soft tissues will shrink and the wound will open. Thus, to realistically simulate soft tissue deformations due to cutting, a model for the residual stress in a patient body is needed. In this paper we present an interactive method to compute a physically meaningful patient-specific residual stress distribution. With our method, by using their experience doctors can sketch directional stress strokes and specify stress magnitudes at a few control points on the body surface. The residual stress is then immediately computed from these inputs and visualized by displaying the deformations of a set of control cuts on the body. In a visually guided session, the user can further modify the initial strokes and magnitudes until a satisfactory result is obtained. We demonstrate the potential of the proposed method for virtual cut simulation by showing the variations of wound openings depending on the residual stress distribution."

In this paper we propose a platform that aims at helping researchers and clinicians to visualise and process such dynamic data, as well as evaluate simulation results. To illustrate this platform we chose to follow a concrete clinical application, the personalised simulation of the Tetralogy of Fallot. We show that the software provides the user with a significant help in the assessment and processing of the 3D+t raw data, as well as an adapted framework for visualisation and evaluation of various dynamic simulation results."

    "abstract": "Classification of image regions is a crucial step in many image segmentation algorithms. Assigning a segment to a certain class can be based on various numerical characteristics such as size, intensity statistics, or shape, which build a multi-dimensional feature space describing the segments. It is commonly unclear and not intuitive, however, how much influence or weight should be assigned to the individual features to obtain a best classification. We propose an interactive supervised approach to the classification step based on a feature-space visualization. Our visualization method helps the user to better understand the structure of the feature space and to interactively optimize feature selection and assigned weights. When investigating labeled training data, the user generates optimal descriptors for each target class. The obtained set of descriptors can then be transferred to classify unlabeled data. We show the effectiveness of our approach by embedding our interactive supervised classification method into a medical image segmentation pipeline for two application scenarios: detecting vertebral bodies in sagittal CT image slices, where we improve the overall accuracy, and detecting the pharynx in head MRI data."

    "abstract": "Personalized anatomical information of the heart is usually obtained from the visual analysis of patient-specific medical images with standard multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) of 2D orthogonal slices, volume rendering and surface mesh views. Commonly, medical data is visualized in 2D flat screens, thus hampering the understanding of 3D complex anatomical details, including incorrect depth/scaling perception, which is critical for some cardiac interventions such as medical device implantations. Virtual reality (VR) is becoming a valid complementary technology overcoming some of the limitations of conventional visualization techniques and allowing an enhanced and fully interactive exploration of human anatomy. In this work, we present VRIDAA, a VR-based platform for the visualization of patient-specific cardiac geometries and the virtual implantation of left atrial appendage occluder (LAAO) devices. It includes different visualization and interaction modes to jointly inspect 3D LA geometries and different LAAO devices, MPR 2D imaging slices, several landmarks and morphological parameters relevant to LAAO, among other functionalities. The platform was designed and tested by two interventional cardiologists and LAAO researchers, obtaining very positive user feedback about its potential, highlighting VRIDAA as a source of motivation for trainees and its usefulness to better understand the required surgical approach before the intervention."

We propose utilizing the Bhattacharyya coefficient of the intensity distributions of these local areas to determine a point-wise weighting scheme for the curve propagation. The performance of our method regarding segmentation quality is evaluated on the segmentation of the hip joint in 10 MRI data sets. Our proposed method shows a clear improvement compared to conventional 3D level set approaches."

    "abstract": "In recent years, radar technology has increasingly been used for the monitoring of bird migration. Marine radars are often utilized for this purpose because of their wide accessibility, range, and resolution. They allow the tracking of birds even at night-when most bird migration takes place-over extended periods of time. This creates a wealth of radar images, for which manual annotation of bird tracks is not feasible. We propose a tool for automatic bird tracking and visualization from marine radar imagery. For this purpose, we developed a bird tracking algorithm for vertically recorded radar images that is able to extract quantitative parameters including flight direction, height, and duration. The results can be qualitatively verified by a visualization design that enables domain experts the time-dependent visualization of bird tracks. Furthermore, it allows a preprocessing of radar images taken by screen capturing for device independence. Our tool was used in an ornithological monitoring study to analyze over 200.000 vertically recorded radar images taken in multiple observation periods and locations."

    "abstract": "Visual clutter is a major problem in large biological data visualization. It is often addressed through the means of level of detail schemes coupled with an appropriate coloring of the visualized structures. Ambient occlusion and shadows are often used to improve the depth perception. However, when used excessively, these techniques are sources of visual clutter themselves. In this paper we present a new approach to screen-space illumination algorithms suitable for use in illustrative visualization. The illumination effect can be controlled so that desired levels of semantic scene organization cast shadows while other remain flat. This way the illumination design can be parameterized to keep visual clutter, originating from illumination, to a minimum, while also guiding the user in a multiscale model exploration. We achieve this by selectively applying occlusion shading based on the inherent semantics of the visualized hierarchically-organized data. The technique is in principle generally applicable to any hierarchically organized 3D scene and has been demonstrated on an exemplary scene from integrative structural biology."

    "abstract": "Depictions of molecular surfaces such as the Solvent Excluded Surface (SES) can provide crucial insight into functional molecular properties, such as the molecule's potential to react. The interactive visualization of single and multiple molecule surfaces is essential for the data analysis by domain experts. Nowadays, the SES can be rendered at high frame rates using shader-based ray casting on the GPU. However, rendering large molecules or larger molecule complexes requires large amounts of memory that has the potential to exceed the memory limitations of current hardware. Here we show that rendering using CPU ray tracing also reaches interactive frame rates without hard limitations to memory. In our results large molecule complexes can be rendered with only the precomputation of each individual SES, and no further involved representation or transformation. Additionally, we provide advanced visualization techniques like ambient occlusion opacity mapping (AOOM) to enhance the comprehensibility of the molecular structure. CPU ray tracing not only provides very high image quality and global illumination, which is beneficial for the perception of spatial structures, it also opens up the possibility to visualize larger data sets and to render on any HPC cluster. Our results demonstrate that simple instancing of geometry keeps the memory consumption for rendering large molecule complexes low, so the examination of much larger data is also possible."

    "abstract": "In mitral valve interventions, surgeons have to select an optimal combination of techniques for every patient. Especially less experienced physicians would benefit from decision support for this process. To support the visual analysis of the patientspecific valvular dynamics and an in-silico pre-intervention simulation of different therapy options, a real-time simulation of the mitral valve is needed, especially for the use in a time-constrained clinical environment. We develop a simplified model of the mitral valve and propose a novel approach to simulate the mitral valve with position-based dynamics. As input, a mesh representation of the open-state mitral valve, two polygons representing the open and closed annulus states, simplified chordae tendineae, and a set of forces for approximating the surrounding blood are required. The mitral valve model can be deformed to simulate the closing and opening as well as incorporate changes caused by virtual interventions in the simulation. For evaluation, ten mitral valves were reconstructed from transesophageal echocardiogram sequences of patients with normal and abnormal physiology. Experts in cardiac surgery annotated anatomical landmarks for valve reconstruction. The simulation results for closing the valve were qualitatively compared to the anatomy depicted in the image sequences and, if present, the reproduction of a prolapse was verified. In addition, two virtual interventions (annuloplasty and clipping) were performed for one case and provided new insights about changes in valve closure and orifice area after modification. Each simulation ran at interactive frame rates. Our approach enables an efficient simulation of the mitral valve with normal and abnormal valve closing behavior as well as virtual interventions. The simulation results showed good agreements with the image data in general and reproduced valve closure in all cases. In three cases, prolapse was not or not correctly reproduced. Further research is needed to parameterize the model in pathologic cases."

    "abstract": "We present a shape processing framework for visual exploration of cellular nuclear envelopes extracted from histology images. The framework is based on a novel shape descriptor of closed contours relying on a geodesically uniform resampling of discrete curves to allow for discrete differential-geometry-based computation of unsigned curvature at vertices and edges. Our descriptor is, by design, invariant under translation, rotation and parameterization. Moreover, it additionally offers the option for uniform-scale-invariance. The optional scale-invariance is achieved by scaling features to z-scores, while invariance under parameterization shifts is achieved by using elliptic Fourier analysis (EFA) on the resulting curvature vectors. These invariant shape descriptors provide an embedding into a fixed-dimensional feature space that can be utilized for various applications: (i) as input features for deep and shallow learning techniques; (ii) as input for dimension reduction schemes for providing a visual reference for clustering collection of shapes. The capabilities of the proposed framework are demonstrated in the context of visual analysis and unsupervised classification of histology images."

    "abstract": "For complex segmentation tasks, fully automatic systems are inherently limited in their achievable accuracy for extracting relevant objects. Especially in cases where only few data sets need to be processed for a highly accurate result, semi-automatic segmentation techniques exhibit a clear benefit for the user. One area of application is medical image processing during an intervention for a single patient.We propose a learning-based cooperative segmentation approach which includes the computing entity as well as the user into the task. Our system builds upon a state-of-the-art fully convolutional artificial neural network (FCN) as well as an active user model for training. During the segmentation process, a user of the trained system can iteratively add additional hints in form of pictorial scribbles as seed points into the FCN system to achieve an interactive and precise segmentation result. The segmentation quality of interactive FCNs is evaluated. Iterative FCN approaches can yield superior results compared to networks without the user input channel component, due to a consistent improvement in segmentation quality after each interaction."

    "abstract": "The characterization of cytoplasmic protein aggregates based on time-lapse fluorescence microscopy imaging data is important for research in neuro-degenerative diseases such as Parkinson. As the manual assessment is time-consuming and subject to significant variability, incentive for the development of an objective automated system is provided. We propose and evaluate a pipeline consisting of cell-segmentation, tracking and classification of neurological cells. Focus is specifically on the novel and challenging classification task which is covered by relying on feature extraction followed by a hybrid classification approach incorporating a support vector machine focusing on mainly stationary information and a hidden Markov model to incorporate temporal context. Several image representations are experimentally evaluated to identify cell properties that are important for discrimination. Relying on the proposed approach, classification accuracies up to 80 % are reached. By extensively analyzing the outcomes, we discuss about strengths and weaknesses of our method as a quantitative assessment tool."

Our algorithm uses an interpolation based on variational implicit functions. Because variational interpolation is computationally expensive, we show how to speed up the algorithm to achieve an interactive calculation time while preserving the overall segmentation quality. The performance improvements are based on a quality preserving reduction of the number of contour points and a fast voxelization strategy for the resulting implicit function. A huge speedup is achieved by the parallelization of the algorithms, utilizing modern 64-bit multi-core CPUs. Finally, we discuss how to make the interpolation algorithm more robust to selfintersecting and reduced contours."

However, a steep learning curve for metabolite interpretation, paired with limited visualization tools, have constrained the more widespread adoption of MRS in clinical practice. In this design study, we collaborated with domain experts to design a novel visualization tool for the exploration of tissue metabolite concentration ratios in MRS clinical and research studies. We present a data and task analysis for this domain, with categorization of MRS data attributes into tiers of visual priority. We furthermore introduce a novel set of visual encodings for these attributes. Our result is SpectraMosaic (Figure 1), an interactive insight-generation tool for rapid exploration and comparison of metabolite ratios. We validate our approach with two case studies from MR spectroscopy experts, providing early qualitative evidence of the efficacy of the system and affording deeper insights into these complex data."

In this paper, we describe a prototype for rehearsing radio-frequency ablation of the myocardium in the context of cardiac arrhythmia. Our main focus has been on the real-time modeling of electrophysiology which is suitable for representing simple cases of arrhythmia (ectopic focus, ventricular tachycardia). To this end, we use an anisotropic multi-front fast marching method to simulate transmembrane potential propagation in cardiac tissues. The electric propagation is coupled with a pre-recorded beating heart model. Thanks to a 3D user interface, the user can interactively measure the local extracellular potential, pace locally the myocardium or simulate the burning of cardiac tissue as done in radiofrequency ablation interventions. To illustrate this work, we show the simulation of various arrhythmias cases built from patient specific medical images including the right and left ventricles, the fiber orientation and the location of ischemic regions."

    "abstract": "Functional brain connectivity from fMRI studies has become an important tool in studying functional interactions in the human brain as a complex network. Most recently, research has started focusing on whole brain functional networks at the voxel-level, where fMRI time-signals at each voxel are correlated with every other voxel in the brain to determine their functional connectivity. For a typical 4mm isotropic voxel resolution, this results in connectivity networks with more than twenty thousand nodes and over 400 million links. These cannot be effectively visualized or interactively explored using node-link representations, and due to their size are challenging to show as correlation matrix bitmaps. In this paper, we present a number of methods for the visualization and interactive visual analysis of this new high resolution brain network data, both in its matrix representation as well as in its anatomical context. We have implemented these methods in a GPU raycasting framework that enables real-time interaction, such as network probing and volume deformation, as well as real-time filtering. The techniques are integrated in a visual analysis application in which the different views are coupled, supporting linked interaction. Furthermore, we allow visual comparison of different brain networks with side-by-side and difference visualization. We have evaluated our approach via case studies with domain scientists at two different university medical centers."

    "abstract": "Fluorescence microscopy provides a powerful method for localization of structures in biological specimens. However, aspects of the image formation process such as noise and blur from the microscope s point-spread function combine to produce an unintuitive image transformation on the true structure of the fluorescing molecules in the specimen, hindering qualitative and quantitative analysis of even simple structures in unprocessed images. We introduce FluoroSim, an interactive fluorescence microscope simulator that can be used to train scientists who use fluorescence microscopy to understand the artifacts that arise from the image formation process, to determine the appropriateness of fluorescence microscopy as an imaging modality in an experiment, and to test and refine hypotheses of model specimens by comparing the output of the simulator to experimental data. FluoroSim renders synthetic fluorescence images from arbitrary geometric models represented as triangle meshes. We describe three rendering algorithms on graphics processing units for computing the convolution of the specimen model with a microscope s point-spread function and report on their performance. We also discuss several cases where the microscope simulator has been used to solve real problems in biology."

    "abstract": "Navigated placement of an ablation applicator in liver surgery would benefit from an effective intraoperative visualization of delicate 3D anatomical structures. In this paper, we propose an approach that facilitates surgery with an interactive as well as an animated map display to support navigated applicator placement in the liver. By reducing the visual complexity of 3D anatomical structures, we provide only the most important information on and around a planned applicator path. By employing different illustrative visualization techniques, the applicator path and its surrounding critical structures, such as blood vessels, are clearly conveyed in an unobstructed way. To retain contextual information around the applicator path and its tip, we desaturate these structures with increasing distance. To alleviate time-consuming and tedious interaction during surgery, our visualization is controlled solely by the position and orientation of a tracked applicator. This enables a direct interaction with the map display without interruption of the intervention. Based on our requirement analysis, we conducted a pilot study with eleven participants and an interactive user study with six domain experts to assess the task completion time, error rate, visual parameters and the usefulness of the animation. The outcome of our pilot study shows that our map display facilitates significantly faster decision making (11.8 s vs. 40.9 s) and significantly fewer false assessments of structures at risk (7.4 % vs. 10.3 %) compared to a currently employed 3D visualization. Furthermore, the animation supports timely perception of the course and depth of upcoming blood vessels, and helps to detect possible areas at risk along the path in advance. Hence, the obtained results demonstrate that our proposed interactive map displays exhibit potential to improve the outcome of navigated liver interventions."

Sensible 3D particle seeding is important in this type of visualisation. We address that problem with a two-step process: Interactive, anatomy-guided slice positioning, and contour-based region of interest specification. Since the deformation calculation is unlikely to be correct everywhere, we derive and visualise an uncertainty measure based on deformed and original MRI data. We also performed a case study evaluation to investigate the benefits of our approach towards orbital fat deformation visualisation."

It uses a simple model of molecular forces to give real time interactive animations of the folding and docking processes. The shape of a molecular strand is shown as a 3D visualisation floating above a 2D triangular matrix representing distance constraints, contact maps or other features of residue pairs. As well as more conventional raster plots, contact maps can be shown with vectors representing the grouping of contacts as secondary structures. The 2D visualisation is also interactive and can be used to manipulate a molecule, define constraints, control and view the folding dynamically, or even design new molecules. While the 3D visualisation is more realistic showing a molecule representation approximating the physical behavior and spatial properties, the 2D visualisation offers greater visibility, in that all molecular positions (and pairings) are always in view; the 3D mode may suffer occlusions and create complex views which are typically hard to understand to humans."

The goal of such planning is to gain a precise understanding of the patho-anatomy of the malformation, specifically about the location and spatial relation of normal and abnormal structures. A key element in this process is the identication and localization of arteries feeding into the lesion, and veins draining it. In this paper, we demonstrate how state-of-the-art techniques from the field of computer graphics and image processing can support neurosurgeons with this task. We address the problem by merging multiple angiographic image sets within a 3D volume rendering pipeline. Datasets from clinical imaging studies were remotely processed at our institute, returned to the institution of origin, and finally visualized in an interactive application, allowing the neurosurgeon to explore the different images simultaneously. Here, we present three case studies along with the medical assessment of an experienced neurosurgeon."

    "abstract": "This work presents a new method for 3D surface detection using a statistical dual-region filter. The method improves over traditional 3D surface detection techniques by resolving interfaces between different stochastic textures, while maintaining the accuracy for gradient based interfaces. Segmentation is commonly applied to 3D image formats such as MRI and CT data to aid high level visualisation and anatomical model creation. Often segmentation is a process which is reliant on accurate surface information and typically gradient-based surface detection methods are applied. These gradient methods identify sharp changes in the image intensity profile, however are known to fail when high levels of noise are present. Often within MRI and CT data, the regions to be segmented are areas of stochastic texture, such as soft tissue structures, this can resemble intensity boundaries corrupted by noise where the intensity profile across the regions remains constant, rendering gradient-based operators less effective. To overcome these issues, we present a surface detection method that employs a dual-region neighbourhood mask, alongside a statistical comparison test. Within this method we assess eight different statistical tests which measure the similarity between the neighbourhood mask regions. The tests presented are mean based, variance based, non-parametric or distribution based. Results from this method show that when a high degree of similarity is found between image regions a non-surface point is detected, and likewise where a low degree of similarity from the tests is found signifies a surface location. Through this process, improved surface segmentation is achieved even in the presence of stochastic texture. We present results to show significant improvements over the 3D Canny method of surface detection and also the 3D Steerable filter method, notably in the detection of surfaces between regions of stochastic texture with high intensity variance. This improvement is further illustrated by our method achieving fewer missed interfaces, more complete surfaces and a measured reduction in spurious surface responses. We employ a Monte-Carlo analysis, involving the development of a synthetic texture interface datasets and the corresponding ground truth solutions. Receiver Operator Characteristic and Precision Recall quantitative performance measures are used to compare against existing state of the art filter methods, and application in real CT and MRI data shows where the improvements can be found."

    "abstract": "Cardiac flow is still not fully understood, and is currently an active research topic. Using phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PC-MRI) blood flow can be measured. For the inspection of such flow, researchers often rely on methods that require additional scans produced by different imaging modalities to provide context. This requires labor-intensive registration and often manual segmentation before any exploration of the data is performed. This work provides a framework that allows for a quick exploration of cardiac flow without the need of additional imaging and time-consuming segmentation. To achieve this, only the 4D data from one PC-MRI scan is used. A context visualization is derived automatically from the data, and provides context for the flow. Instead of relying on segmentation to deliver an accurate context, the heart's ventricles are approximated by half-ellipsoids that can be placed with minimal user interaction. Furthermore, seeding positions for flow visualization can be placed automatically in areas of interest defined by the user and based on derived flow features. The framework enables a user to do a fast initial exploration of cardiac flow, as is demonstrated by a use case and a user study involving cardiac blood flow researchers."

    "abstract": "An important and underestimated task to support reading of images in radiology is a proper annotation of findings. In radiology reading, 2D slice images from a given modality (e.g. CT or MRI) need to be analyzed carefully by a radiologist, whereas all clinical relevant findings have to be annotated in the images. This includes information in particular for documentation, follow-up investigations and medical team meetings. The main problem of the automatic placement of labels in a clinical context is to find an arrangement of multiple variable-sized labels which guarantees readability, clearness and unambiguity and avoids occlusion of the image itself. Based on a case study of abdominal CT-Images in an oncologic context we analyze the main constraints for label placement in order to extract candidate label positions, evaluate these and determine valid and good label positions. Based on this preprocessing step, different approaches can be applied for placing multiple labels in a scene. We present a new method called Shifting and compare it to other labeling strategies."

    "abstract": "Deep learning is increasingly used in the field of glaucoma research. Although deep learning models can achieve high accuracy, issues with trust, interpretability, and practical utility form barriers to adoption in clinical practice. In this study, we explore whether and how visualizations of deep learning-based measurements can be used for glaucoma management in the clinic. Through iterative design sessions with ophthalmologists, vision researchers, and manufacturers of optical coherence tomography (OCT) instruments, we distilled four main tasks, and designed a visualization tool that incorporates a visual field (VF) prediction model to provide clinical decision support in managing glaucoma progression. The tasks are: (1) assess reliability of a prediction, (2) understand why the model made a prediction, (3) alert to features that are relevant, and (4) guide future scheduling of VFs. Our approach is novel in that it considers utility of the system in a clinical context where time is limited. With use cases and a pilot user study, we demonstrate that our approach can aid clinicians in clinical management decisions and obtain appropriate trust in the system. Taken together, our work shows how visual explanations of automated methods can augment clinicians' knowledge and calibrate their trust in DL-based measurements during clinical decision making."

    "abstract": "In the past years sophisticated automatic segmentation algorithms for various medical image segmentation problems have been developed. However, there are always cases where automatic algorithms fail to provide an acceptable segmentation. In these cases the user needs efficient segmentation correction tools, a problem which has not received much attention in research. Cases to be manually corrected are often particularly difficult and the image does often not provide enough information for segmentation, so we present an image-independent method for intuitive sketch-based editing of 3D tumor segmentations. It is based on an object reconstruction using variational interpolation and can be used in any 3D modality, such as CT or MRI. We also discuss sketch-based editing in 2D as well as a hole-correction approach for variational interpolation. Our manual correction algorithm has been evaluated on 89 segmentations of tumors in CT by 2 technical experts with 6+ years of experience in tumor segmentation and assessment. The experts rated the quality of our correction tool as acceptable or better in 92.1% of the cases. They needed a median number of 4 correction steps with one step taking 0.4s on average."

    "abstract": "Medical illustrations can make powerful use of texture synthesis to convey information about anatomic structures in an attractive, effective and understandable way. Current visualization methods are not capable of conveying detailed information about the orientation, internal structure, and other local properties of the anatomical objects for a particular patient because imaging modalities such as CT or MRI do not capture this information. In this paper, a new anatomical rendering method that utilizes model-based synthesis of 3D textures is proposed in order to distinguish and illustrate different structures inside the model. The goal of our volume illustration approach is to visualize structural information by considering directions and layers in synthesizing high-quality, high-resolution solid textures. Our method uses medial coordinates of 3D models and 2D exemplar textures to generate solid textures that change progressively in orientation and material according to the local orientation and transition information implicit in the anatomic region.Discrete medial 3D anatomical models (\"m-reps\") provide the orientation field and texture variation maps inside image regions. In our paper, we demonstrate the robustness of our method with a variety of textures applied to different anatomical structures, such as muscles, and mandible."

    "abstract": "When Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is used in clinical studies, statistical hypothesis testing is the standard approach to establish significant differences between groups, such as patients and healthy controls. However, diffusion tensors contain six degrees of freedom, and the most commonly used univariate tests reduce them to a single scalar, such as Fractional Anisotropy. Multivariate tests that account for the full tensor information have been developed, but have not been widely adopted in practice. Based on analyzing the limitations of existing univariate and multivariate tests, we argue that it is beneficial to use a more flexible, steerable test. Therefore, we introduce a test that can be customized to include any subset of tensor attributes that are relevant to the analysis task at hand. We also present a visual analytics system that supports the exploratory task of customizing it to a specific scenario. Our system closely integrates quantitative analysis with suitable visualizations. It links spatial and abstract views to reveal clusters of strong differences, to relate them to the affected anatomical structures, and to visually compare the results of different tests. A use case is presented in which our system leads to the formation of several new hypotheses about the effects of systemic lupus erythematosus on water diffusion in the brain."

In this work a new method is proposed for the automated detection of the retinal vessels. Three new and important contributions are made. First, a new method capable of vessel enhancement is presented. Second, a new criterium to remove some false vessels caused by the proximity to bright regions is presented, avoiding the false vessels created by the presence of exudates or bright artifacts. Third, a new method that discards the false vessel regions that usually tends to appear in the border of the optic disc. This is achieved using the derivatives of the gradient magnitude local maxima over different scales. The performance evaluation is made on two publicly available databases, namely, STARE, and HRF with state-of-the-art results. Particularly, the described method reveals to be very reliable on retinal images with large pathological signs."

    "abstract": "A method is proposed for quantifying differences between multichannel EEG coherence networks represented by functional unit (FU) maps. The approach is based on inexact graph matching for attributed relational graphs and graph averaging, adapted to FU maps. The mean of a set of input FU maps is defined in such a way that it not only represents the mean group coherence during a certain task or condition but also to some extent displays individual variations in brain activity. The definition of a mean FU map relies on a graph dissimilarity measure which takes into account both node positions and node or edge attributes. A visualization of the mean FU map is used with a visual representation of the frequency of occurrence of nodes and edges in the input FUs. This makes it possible to investigate which brain regions are more commonly involved in a certain task, by analysing the occurrence of an FU of the mean graph in the input FUs. Furthermore, our method gives the possibility to quantitatively compare individual FU maps by computing their distance to the mean FU map."

We apply five different smoothing techniques, namely Gaussian smoothing, nonlinear Gaussian smoothing, median filtering, anisotropic diffusion, and minimum description length segmentation, and compare them to each other. The processing pipeline is completed by subsequent automatic thresholding using Otsu s method and hepatocyte detection using Hough transform. We compare the quantification results in terms of quality (sensitivity and specificity rates) against the manually specified ground truth. We discuss the results and limitations of the individual processing steps as well as of the overall automatic quantification approach."

    "abstract": "The advances in high-throughput digitization, digital pathology systems, and quantitative image analysis opened new horizons in pathology. The diagnostic work of the pathologists and their role is likely to be augmented with computer-assistance and more quantitative information at hand. The recent success of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision methods demonstrated that in the coming years machines will support pathologists in typically tedious and highly subjective tasks and also in better patient stratification. In spite of clear future improvements in the diagnostic workflow, questions on how to effectively support the pathologists and how to integrate current data sources and quantitative information still persist. In this context, Visual Analytics (VA) - as the discipline that aids users to solve complex problems with an interactive and visual approach - can play a vital role to support the cognitive skills of pathologists and the large volumes of data available. To identify the main opportunities to employ VA in digital pathology systems, we conducted a survey with 20 pathologists to characterize the diagnostic practice and needs from a user perspective. From our findings, we discuss how VA can leverage quantitative image data to empower pathologists with new advanced digital pathology systems."

In our approach, the 2D-3D registration is done with a hierarchical two-stage strategy: the scaled rigid 2D-3D registration stage followed by a regularized deformable b-spline 2D-3D registration stage. In both stages, a set of control points with uniform spacing are placed over the domain of the 3D volumetric template first. The registrations are then driven by computing updated positions of these control points with intensity-based 2D-2D image registrations of C-arm images with the associated digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs), which then allows computing the associated registration transformation at each stage. In order to account for intensity nonstationarities and complex spatially-varying intensity distortion in the deformable b-spline 2D-3D registration stage, the intensity-based 2D-2D image registrations at this stage are done based on minimizing the complexity of the residual images between the C-arm images and the associated DRRs. Comprehensive experiments on simulated images, on images of cadaveric femurs and on clinical datasets are designed and conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation results are given, which demonstrate the efficacy of the present approach."

These tunnels facilitate the transport of small molecules, water solvent and ions in many proteins. They help researchers understand the structure-function relationships of proteins and the knowledge of tunnel properties improves the design of new inhibitors. Our methods are derived from selected tunnel representations when each stresses some of the important tunnel properties-width, shape, mapping of physico-chemical properties, etc. Our methods provide smooth animation of the movement of tunnels as they change their length and shape throughout the simulation."

    "abstract": "Four-dimensional phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (4D PC-MRI) is a method to non-invasively acquire in-vivo blood flow, e.g. in the aorta. It produces three-dimensional, time-resolved datasets containing both flow speed and direction for each voxel. In order to perform qualitative and quantitative data analysis on these datasets, a vessel segmentation is often required. These segmentations are mostly performed manually or semi-automatically, based on three-dimensional intensity images containing the maximal flow speed over all time steps. To allow for a faster segmentation, we propose a method that, in addition to intensity, incorporates the flow trajectories into the segmentation process. This is accomplished by extracting Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) from the flow data, which indicate physical boundaries in a dynamical system. To approximate LCS in our discrete images, we employ Finite Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE) fields to quantify the rate of separation of neighboring flow trajectories. LCS appear as ridges or valleys in FTLE images, indicating the presence of either a flow structure boundary or physical boundary. We will show that the process of segmenting low-contrast 4D PC-MRI datasets can be simplified by using the generated FLTE data in combination with intensity images."

Used concomitantly with a virtual environment it can further enhance a user's immersive experience whilst they interact with computer graphics. Haptic Feedback has been applied to the study of molecular systems for several years, however, computation requirements have hampered progress. Most popular representations of molecules comprise of primitive shapes like spheres. Many molecules, especially proteins, potentially contain thousands of atoms each of which can be represented as a single sphere and will need to be processed for collision in the haptic rendering loop. Current systems often simulate stiff contacts with a proxy system based on tracking a point over planar surfaces. In this paper a novel method for the haptic rendering of a space filling molecule representation is presented. The technique reduces the time taken to detect and respond to the collisions and improves the overall spherical feel of the molecule by using the implicit description of spheres to track the surface as opposed to a polygonal approximation."

We use a suitable robust, noise-resistant skeletonization algorithm to extract the full 3D skeleton of the given surface, and subsequently compute a surface classifier that separates convex ridges from quasi-flat regions, using the feature points of the simplified skeleton. We demonstrate our method on voxel surfaces extracted from actual anatomical scans, with a focus on cortical surfaces, and compare our results with curvature-based classifiers. As a second application of the 3D skeleton, we show how a partitioning of the brain skeleton can be used in a preprocessing step for the brain surface analysis."

We propose view-dependent circle glyphs that enhance depth perception in vascular models. The glyphs are automatically placed on vessel end-points in a balanced manner. For this, we introduce a vessel end-point detection algorithm as a pre-processing step and an extensible, feature-driven glyph filtering strategy. Our glyphs are simple to implement and allow an enhanced and quick judgment of the depth value that they represent. We conduct a qualitative evaluation to compare our approach with two existing approaches, that enhance depth perception with illustrative visualization techniques. The evaluation shows that our glyphs perform better in the general case and decisively outperform the reference techniques when it comes to just noticeable differences."

Traditional detection methods are based on calculating image features at discrete positions on the colon wall. However large-scale surface shapes are not captured. This paper presents a novel approach to aggregate surface shape information for automatic polyp detection. The iso-surface of the colon wall can be partitioned into geometrically homogeneous regions based on clustering of curvature lines, using a spectral clustering algorithm and a symmetric line similarity measure. Each partition corresponds with the surface area that is covered by a single cluster. For each of the clusters, a number of features are calculated, based on the volumetric shape index and the surface curvedness, to select the surface partition corresponding to the cap of a polyp. We have applied our clustering approach to nine annotated patient datasets. Results show that the surface partition-based features are highly correlated with true polyp detections and can thus be used to reduce the number of false-positive detections."

    "abstract": "An electroencephalography (EEG) coherence network represents functional brain connectivity, and is constructed by calculating the coherence between pairs of electrode signals as a function of frequency. Visualization of coherence networks can provide insight into unexpected patterns of cognitive processing and help neuroscientists to understand brain mechanisms. However, visualizing dynamic EEG coherence networks is a challenge for the analysis of brain connectivity, especially when the spatial structure of the network needs to be taken into account. In this paper, we present a design and implementation of a visualization framework for such dynamic networks. First, requirements for supporting typical tasks in the context of dynamic functional connectivity network analysis were collected from neuroscience researchers. In our design, we consider groups of network nodes and their corresponding spatial location for visualizing the evolution of the dynamic coherence network. We introduce an augmented timeline-based representation to provide an overview of the evolution of functional units (FUs) and their spatial location over time. This representation can help the viewer to identify relations between functional connectivity and brain regions, as well as to identify persistent or transient functional connectivity patterns across the whole timewindow. In addition, we modified the FU map representation to facilitate comparison of the behavior of nodes between consecutive FU maps. Our implementation also supports interactive exploration. The usefulness of our visualization design was evaluated by an informal user study. The feedback we received shows that our design supports exploratory analysis tasks well. The method can serve as an preprocessing step before a complete analysis of dynamic EEG coherence networks."

We investigated depth perception comparing a 2D display with a glasses-free 3D autostereoscopic display in detail and conducted a follow-up study with the new 3D zSpace technology including a stylus as input device. This work comprises the design of a tympanoplastic training scenario used as the study's \"real world task\". Participants had to position a prosthesis implant to reconstruct the ossicular chain and thus a patient's hearing ability. The study revealed an overwhelming support of the 3D autostereoscopic display compared to a 2D display regarding depth judgment, task completion time and the number of required scene and prosthesis interactions."

    "abstract": "In the Molecular Dynamics (MD) visualization literature, different approaches are utilized to study protein-lipid interactions (PLI) and protein-protein interaction (PPI) in decoupled contexts. However, the two types of interaction occur in the same space-time domain. It is beneficial to study the PLI and PPI in a unified context. Nevertheless, the simulation's size, length, and complexity increase the challenge of understanding the dynamic behavior. We propose a novel framework consisting of four linked views, a time-dependent 3D view, a novel hybrid view, a clustering timeline, and a details-on-demand window. We introduce a selection of visual designs to convey the behavior of PLI and PPI through a unified coordinate system. Abstraction is used to present proteins in hybrid 2D space, a projected tiled space is used to present both PLI and PPI at the particle level in a heat-map style visual design while glyphs are used to represent PPI at the molecular level. We couple visually separable visual designs in a unified coordinate space. The result lets the user study both PLI and PPI separately or together in a unified visual analysis framework. We also exemplify its use with case studies focusing on protein clustering and we report domain expert feedback."

    "abstract": "In this paper, we make contributions to the visualization of vascular structures. Based on skeletal input data, we provide a combined 2D and implicit 3D visualization of vasculature, that is parameterized on-the-fly for illustrative visualization. We use an efficient algorithm that creates a distance field volume from triangles and extend it to handle skeletal tree data. Spheretracing this volume allows to visualize the vasculature in a flexible way, without the need to recompute the volume. Illustrative techniques, that have been frequently applied to vascular visualizations often require texture coordinates. Therefore, modifying an object-based algorithm, we propose an image-based, hierarchical optimization process that allows to derive periodic texture coordinates in a frame-coherent way and suits the implicit representation of the vascular structures. In addition to the 3D surface visualization, we propose a simple layout algorithm that applies a 2D parameterization to the skeletal tree nodes. This parameterization can be used to color-code the vasculature or to plot a 2D overview-graph, that highlights the branching topology of the skeleton. We transfer measurements, done in 3D space, to the 2D plot in order to avoid visual clutter and self occlusions in the 3D representation. A visual link between the 3D and 2D views is established via color codes and texture patterns. The potential of our pipeline is shown in several prototypical application scenarios."

The study aimed at identifying parameters suitable for diagnosing and prognosticating the volume state-a crucial and difficult task in intensive care medicine. In intensive care, most assessments not only depend on a single measurement but a plethora of mixed measurements over time. Even for trained experts, efficient and accurate analysis of such multivariate time-dependent data remains a challenging task. We present a linked-view post hoc visual analysis application that reduces data complexity by combining projection-based time curves for overview with small multiples for details on demand. Our approach supports not only the analysis of individual patients but also the analysis of ensembles by adapting existing techniques using non-parametric statistics. We evaluated the effectiveness and acceptance of our application through expert feedback with domain scientists from the surgical department using real-world data: the results show that our approach allows for detailed analysis of changes in patient state while also summarizing the temporal development of the overall condition. Furthermore, the medical experts believe that our method can be transferred from medical research to the clinical context, for example, to identify the early onset of a sepsis."

This information can in turn be placed into the context of a CT or MRI scan of the same patient. However for such an approach many image processing challenges need to be overcome and sources of error addressed, including reconstruction drift, anatomical deformations, varying appearance of anatomy, and imaging artifacts. In this work, we present a fully automatic system including robust image-based ultrasound tracking, a novel learning-based global initialization of the anatomical context, and joint mono- and multi-modal registration. In an evaluation on 4D US sequences and MRI scans of eight volunteers we achieve automatic reconstruction and registration without any user interaction, assess the registration errors based on physician-defined landmarks, and demonstrate realtime tracking of free-breathing sequences."

    "abstract": "Vessel segmentation is an important prerequisite for many medical applications. While automatic vessel segmentation is an active field of research, interaction and visualization techniques for semi-automatic solutions have gotten far less attention. Nevertheless, since automatic techniques do not generally achieve perfect results, interaction is necessary. Especially for tasks that require an in-detail inspection or analysis of the shape of vascular structures precise segmentations are essential. However, in many cases these can only be generated by incorporating expert knowledge. In this paper we propose a visual vessel segmentation system that allows the user to interactively generate vessel segmentations. Therefore, we employ multiple linked views which allow to assess different aspects of the segmentation and depict its different quality metrics. Based on these quality metrics, the user is guided, can assess the segmentation quality in detail and modify the segmentation accordingly. One common modification is the editing of branches, for which we propose a semi-automatic sketch-based interaction metaphor. Additionally, the user can also influence the shape of the vessel wall or the centerline through sketching. To assess the value of our system we discuss feedback from medical experts and have performed a thorough evaluation."

To make the interpretation during the education phase easier, we enhance the visualization during liver examinations with an abstracted depiction of relevant anatomical structures, here denoted as illustrated ultrasound. The specifics of enhancing structures are available through an interactively co-registered computed tomography, which has been enhanced by semantic information. To assist the orientation in the liver, we partition the liver into Couinaud segments. They are defined in a rapid segmentation process based on linked 2D slice views and 3D exploded views. The semantics are interactively related from the co-registered modality to the real-time ultrasound via co-registration. During the illustrated ultrasound examination training we provide visual enhancements that depict which liver segments are intersected by the ultrasound slice."

    "abstract": "The study and visualization of vascular structures, using 3D models obtained from medical data, is an active field of research. Illustrative visualizations have been applied to this domain in multiple ways. Researchers have tried to make the geometric properties of vasculature more comprehensive and to augment the surface with representations of multivariate clinical data. Techniques that head beyond the application of color-maps or simple shading approaches require a sort of surface parameterization, i.e., texture coordinates, in order to overcome locality. When extracting 3D models, the computation of texture coordinates on the mesh is not always part of the data processing pipeline. We combine existing techniques to a simple, yet effective, parameterization approach that is suitable for tree-like structures. The parameterization is done w.r.t. to a pre-defined source vertex. For this, we present an automatic algorithm, that detects the root of a tree-structure. The parameterization is partly done in screen-space and recomputed per frame. However, the screen-space computation comes with positive features that are not present in object-space approaches. We show how the resulting texture coordinates can be used for varying hatching, contour parameterization, the display of decals, as an additional depth cue and feature extraction."

    "abstract": "User studies are often required in biomedical visualization application papers in order to provide evidence for the utility of the presented approach. An important aspect is how well depth information can be perceived, as depth encoding is important to enable an understandable representation of complex data. Unfortunately, in practice there is often little time available to perform such studies, and setting up and conducting user studies may be labor-intensive. In addition, it can be challenging to reach enough participants to support the contribution claims of the paper. In this paper, we propose a system that allows biomedical visualization researchers to quickly generate perceptual task-based user studies for novel surface visualizations, and to perform the resulting experiment via a web interface. This approach helps to reduce effort in the setup of user studies themselves, and at the same time leverages a web-based approach that can help researchers attract more participants to their study. We demonstrate our system using the specific application of depth judgment tasks to evaluate vascular surface visualizations, since there is a lot of recent interest in this area. However, the system is also generally applicable for conducting other task-based user studies in biomedical visualization."

Another option is to use manually matched node-pairs, but this enormously slows down the process. Our contribution to the state of the art is to combine the advantages of both solutions. We enhance the automatic tree matching algorithm designed by Graham et al., so that it is possible to interact with it by previously selecting important matches or by subsequently fixing the provided wrong matches. Thanks to this enhancement the speed of the algorithm is greatly increased. It takes 7.45 seconds for trees up to 192 nodes and less than 1 second if three input matches are provided. In addition to this an in-depth evaluation of the robustness of the algorithm is presented. The results are remarkable. The average of wrong matches varies between 1.17 and 1.4 node-pairs in the worst cases. The rate of correct matches is high."

Yet, existing approaches for the visualization of networks are general purpose techniques that are often not suited to support the specific needs of researchers in the life sciences, or to handle the large network sizes and specific network characteristics that are prevalent in the field. Examples for such networks are biomedical ontologies and biochemical reaction networks, which are bipartite networks   a particular graph class which is rarely addressed in visualization. Our table-based approach allows to visualize large bipartite networks alongside with a multitude of attributes and hyperlinks to biological databases. To explore complex network motifs and perform intricate selections within the visualized network data, we introduce a new script-based brushing mechanism that integrates naturally with the interlinked, tabular representation. A prototype for exploring bipartite graphs, which uses the proposed visualization and interaction techniques, is also presented and used on real data sets from the application domain."

Most registration software packages do not provide an easy-to-use interface that facilitates the use of registration. 2D visualization techniques are often used for visualizing 3D datasets. RegistrationShop was developed to improve and ease the process of volume registration using 3D visualizations and intuitive interactive tools. It supports several basic visualizations of 3D volumetric data. Interactive rigid and non-rigid transformation tools can be used to manipulate the volumes and immediate visual feedback for all rigid transformation tools allows the user to examine the current result in real-time. In this context, we introduce 3D comparative visualization techniques, as well as a way of placing landmarks in 3D volumes. Finally, we evaluated our approach with domain experts, who underlined the potential and usefulness of RegistrationShop."

    "abstract": "Visualization of multimodal images in medicine and other application areas requires correct and efficient registration. Optimally, the alignment operation is made an integral part of the rendering process. Voxel based approaches using mutual information ensure high quality similarity measurement. As a limiting factor, high computational load is caused since for every iteration of the optimization procedure one volume is transformed into the coordinate system of the other, a 2D histogram is generated and mutual information is computed. The expensive trilinear interpolation operations are well supported by 3D texture mapping hardware. However, existing strategies compute the histogram and mutual information on the CPU and thus require a cost intensive data transfer. Overcoming this considerable bottleneck, we introduce a new approach that efficiently supports all computations on modern graphics cards. This makes expensive data transfers from GPU to main memory dispensable. Due to its modularity, the presented approach can be integrated into general frameworks. As a major result, the speed improvement over existing GPU-CPU strategies amounts to a factor of 4 and over pure conventional CPU techniques to more than a factor of 10. Overall, the suggested strategy contributes considerably to integration of multimodal registration directly into interactive volume visualization."

    "abstract": "Ultrasound as an acoustic imaging modality suffers from various kinds of noise. The presence of noise especially hinders the 3D visualization of ultrasound data, both in terms of resolving the spatial occlusion of the signal by surrounding noise, and mental decoupling of the signal from noise. This paper presents a novel type of structurepreserving filter that has been specifically designed to eliminate the presence of speckle and random noise in 3D ultrasound datasets. This filter is based on a local distribution of variance for a given voxel. The lowest variance direction is assumed to be aligned with the direction of the structure. A streamline integration over the lowest-variance vector field defines the filtered output value. The new filter is compared to other popular filtering approaches and its superiority is documented on several use cases. A case study where a clinician was delineating vascular structures of the liver from 3D visualizations further demonstrates the benefits of our approach compared to the state of the art."

    "abstract": "In direct volume rendering (DVR) and related techniques a basic operation is the classification of data values by mapping (mostly scalar) intensities to color values using a transfer function. However, in some cases this kind of mapping might not suffice to achieve satisfying rendering results, for instance when intensity homogeneities occur in the volume data due to technical restrictions of the scanner technology. In this case it might be desirable to customize one or more parameters of the visualization depending on the position within the volume. In this paper we propose a novel approach for an interactive position-dependent customization of arbitrary parameters of the transfer function classification. Our method can easily be integrated into existing volume rendering pipelines by incorporating an additional operation during the classification step. It allows the user to interactively modify the rendering result by specifying reference points within the data set and customizing their associated visualization parameters while receiving direct visual feedback. Since the additional memory requirements of our method do not depend on the size of the visualized data our approach is applicable to large data sets, for instance in the field of ultra microscopy."

They serve to focus discussions, present results of collaborative decision making, record and forward diagnostic findings, support orientation in complex or unfamiliar views on the data, and study anatomy. Different techniques have been presented for labeling the original data in 2D slice views, surface representations of structures extracted from the data, e.g., organs and vasculature, and 3D volume rendered representations of the data. All aim at a clear visual association of labels and structures, visible and legible labels, and a fast and aesthetic labeling while considering individual properties of the data and its representation and tackling various issues, e.g., occlusion of structures by labels, overlapping labels, and crossings of lines connecting labels with structures. We survey the medical labeling work and propose a classification with respect to the employed labeling technique. We give guidelines for choosing a technique dependent on the data representation, e.g., surface rendering or slice view, the type of structures to be labeled, and the individual requirements on an effective label layout."

Our approach generates slide-based, interactive sculptures-called volograms-that resemble holograms of underlying medical data. The volograms are made out of affordable and readily available materials (e.g., transparent foils and cardboard) and can be produced through commonly available means. To evaluate the educational value of the proposed approach with our target audience, we assess the volograms, as opposed to classical, on-screen medical visualizations in a user study. The results of our study, while highlighting current weaknesses of our physicalization, also point to interesting future directions."

    "abstract": "We present an interactive visual environment for linked analysis of brain imaging and clinical measurements. The environment is developed in an iterative participatory design process involving neuroscientists investigating the causes of brain-related complex diseases. The hypotheses formation process about correlations between active brain regions and physiological or psychological factors in studies with hundreds of subjects is a central part of the investigation. Observing the reasoning patterns during hypotheses formation, we concluded that while existing tools provide powerful analysis options, they lack effective interactive exploration, thus limiting the scientific scope and preventing extraction of knowledge from available data. Based on these observations, we designed methods that support neuroscientists by integrating their existing statistical analysis of multivariate subject data with interactive visual exploration to enable them to better understand differences between patient groups and the complex bidirectional interplay between clinical measurement and the brain. These exploration concepts enable neuroscientists, for the first time during their investigations, to interactively move between and reason about questions such as 'which clinical measurements are correlated with a specific brain region?' or 'are there differences in brain activity between depressed young and old subjects?'. The environment uses parallel coordinates for effective overview and selection of subject groups, Welch's t-test to filter out brain regions with statistically significant differences, and multiple visualizations of Pearson correlations between brain regions and clinical parameters to facilitate correlation analysis. A qualitative user study was performed with three neuroscientists from different domains. The study shows that the developed environment supports simultaneous analysis of more parameters, provides rapid pathways to insights, and is an effective support tool for hypothesis formation."

    "abstract": "Multi-shell diffusion MRI and Diffusion Spectrum Imaging are modern neuroimaging modalities that acquire diffusion weighted images at a high angular resolution, while also probing varying levels of diffusion weighting (b values). This yields large and intricate data for which very few interactive visualization techniques are currently available. We designed and implemented the first system that permits an interactive, iteratively refined classification of such data, which can serve as a foundation for isosurface visualizations and direct volume rendering. Our system leverages features learned by a Convolutional Neural Network. CNNs are state of the art for representation learning, but training them is too slow for interactive use. Therefore, we combine a computationally efficient random forest classifier with autoencoder based features that can be pre-computed by the CNN. Since features from existing CNN architectures are not suitable for this purpose, we design a specific dual-branch CNN architecture, and carefully evaluate our design decisions. We demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate classifications compared to learning with raw data, established domain-specific features, or PCA dimensionality reduction."

    "abstract": "Tubular flow analysis plays an important role in many fields, such as for blood flow analysis in medicine, e.g., for the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases and treatment planning. Phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PC-MRI) allows for noninvasive in vivo-measurements of such tubular flow, but may suffer from imaging artifacts. New acquisition techniques (or sequences) that are being developed to increase image quality and reduce measurement time have to be validated against the current clinical standard. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), on the other hand, allows for simulating noise-free tubular flow, but optimization of the underlying model depends on multiple parameters and can be a tedious procedure that may run into local optima. Data assimilation is the process of optimally combining the data from both PC-MRI and CFD domains. We present an interactive visual analysis approach to support domain experts in the above-mentioned fields by addressing PC-MRI and CFD ensembles as well as their combination. We develop a multi-field similarity measure including both scalar and vector fields to explore common hemodynamic parameters, and visualize the evolution of the ensemble similarities in a low-dimensional embedding. Linked views to spatial visualizations of selected time steps support an in-detail analysis of the spatio-temporal distribution of differences. To evaluate our system, we reached out to experts from the PC-MRI and CFD domains and summarize their feedback."

Despite the numerous advantages, HIFU techniques do not reach the high delivery precision like other therapies (e.g., radiotherapy). For this reason, a correct therapy planning and monitoring in HIFU treatments remains a challenge. We propose HIFUpm, a visual analytics approach which enables the visualization of the HIFU simulation results, while guiding the user in the evaluation of the procedure. We illustrate the use of HIFUpm for an ablative treatment of an osteoid osteoma. This use case demonstrates that HIFUpm provides a flexible visual environment to plan and monitor HIFU procedures."

We propose to progressively simplify tractograms by grouping similar fibers into generalized cylinders. This produces a fine-grained multiresolution model that provides a progressive and real-time navigation through different levels of detail. This model preserves the overall structure of the tractogram and can be adapted to different measures of similarity. We also provide an efficient implementation of the method based on a Delaunay tetrahedralization. We illustrate our method using the Human Connectome Project dataset."

    "abstract": "Four-dimensional phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (4D PC-MRI) is a relatively young image modality that allows the non-invasive acquisition of time-resolved, three-dimensional blood flow information. Stroke volumes and regurgitation fractions are two of the main measures to assess the cardiac function and severity of pathologies. The flow volumes in forward and backward direction through a plane inside the vessel are required for their quantification. Unfortunately, the calculations are highly sensitive towards the plane's angulation since orthogonally passing flow is considered. This often leads to physiologically implausible results. In this work, a robust quantification method is introduced to overcome this problem. Collaborating radiologists and cardiologists were carefully observed while estimating stroke volumes in various healthy volunteer and patient datasets with conventional quantification. This facilitated the automatization of their approach which, in turn, allows to derive statistical information about the plane angulation sensitivity. Moreover, the experts expect a continuous decrease of the stroke volume along the vessel course after a peak value above the aortic valve. Conventional methods are often unable to produce this behavior. Thus, we present a procedure to fit a function that ensures such physiologically plausible results. In addition, the technique was adapted for the robust quantification of regurgitation fractions. The performed qualitative evaluation shows the capability of our method to support diagnosis, a parameter evaluation confirms the robustness. Vortex flow was identified as main cause for quantification uncertainties."

Our application is used to analyze existing rehabilitation data from a large cohort of 46,000 patients, and it is the first integrated solution of its kind. It incorporates functionalities for data preprocessing (profiling, wrangling and cleansing), storage, visualization, and predictive analysis on the basis of retrospective outcomes. A positive feedback from the first evaluation with domain experts indicates the usefulness of the newly proposed approach and represents a solid foundation for the introduction of visual analytics to the rehabilitation domain."

    "abstract": "Nowadays, many surgical procedures require preoperative planning, mostly relying on data from 3D imaging techniques like computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. However, preoperative assessment of this data is carried out on the PC (using classical CT/MR viewing software) and not on the patient's body itself. Therefore, surgeons need to transfer both their overall understanding of the patient's individual anatomy and also specific markers and labels for important points from the PC to the patient only with the help of imaginative power or approximative measurement. In order to close the gap between preoperative planning on the PC and surgery on the patient, we propose a system to directly project preoperative knowledge to the body surface by projection mapping. As a result, we are able to display both assigned labels and a volumetric and view-dependent view of the 3D data in-situ. Furthermore, we offer a method to interactively navigate through the data and add 3D markers directly in the projected volumetric view. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach using DIEP flap breast reconstruction as an example. By means of a small pilot study, we show that our method outperforms standard surgical planning in accuracy and can easily be understood and utilized even by persons without any medical knowledge."

Our approach is based on a multilinear model that describes the correlation between the skull and the facial soft tissue thickness (FSTT) on the one hand and the head/face surface geometry on the other hand. Training this model requires to densely sample the Cartesian product space of skull shape times FSTT variation, which cannot be obtained by measurements alone. We generate this data by enriching measured data-volumetric computed tomography scans and 3D surface scans of the head-by simulating statistically plausible FSTT variations. We demonstrate the versatility of our novel multilinear model by estimating faces from given skulls as well as skulls from given faces within just a couple of seconds. To foster further research in this direction, we will make our multilinear model publicly available."

The whole pipeline of processing algorithms is presented, starting from generating topologically equivalent surface meshes, followed by solving the correspondence problem, and, finally, creating a surface morphing. In this pipeline, we address all the challenges that are due to dealing with complex biological, non-isometric objects. For biological objects it is often particularly important to obtain deformations that look as realistic as possible. In addition, spatially non-uniform shape morphings that only change one part of the surface and keep the rest as stable as possible are of interest for evolutionary studies, since functional modules often change independently from one another. We use Poisson interpolation for this purpose and show that it is well suited to generate both global and local shape deformations."

Additionally, other parameters, such as gradient magnitude, are often retrieved for each sample point. To find a good transfer function for this high number of parameters is challenging because of the complexity of this task. In this paper we present a general information-based approach for transfer function design in multimodal visualization which is independent of the used modality types. Based on information theory, the complex multi-dimensional transfer function space is fused to allow utilization of a well-known 2D transfer function with a single value and gradient magnitude as parameters. Additionally, a quantity is introduced which enables better separation of regions with complementary information. The benefit of the new method in contrast to other techniques is a transfer function space which is easy to understand and which provides a better separation of different tissues. The usability of the new approach is shown on examples of different modalities."

Our method uses the structure's specific meta data and geometric information to determine an importance value for each structure automatically. This importance value encodes the structure's priority for the current question and defines the structure's category. Furthermore, this value can be used to define a structure-specific visual style to generate expressive 3D surgery planning visualizations."

    "abstract": "The structural organization of neural circuitry is an important determinant of brain function. Thus, knowing the brain's wiring (the connectome) is key to understanding how it works. For example, understanding how sensory information is translated into behavior requires a comprehensive view of the microcircuits performing this translation at the level of individual neurons and synapses. Obtaining a wiring diagram, however, is nontrivial due to size, complexity and accessibility of the involved brain regions. Even when such data were available, it were difficult to analyze. Here we describe how a network of  around 0.5 million neurons and their synaptic connections, representing the vibrissal area of the rat primary somatosensory cortex, can be reconstructed. Furthermore, we present a framework for visual exploration of synaptic connectivity between (groups of) neurons within this model. It includes, first, the Cortical Column Connectivity Viewer (CCCV) that provides a hybrid abstract/spatial representation of the connections between neurons of different cell types and/or in different cortical columns. Second, it comprises a 3D view of cell type-specific synapse positions on selected morphologies. This framework is thus an effective tool to visually explore structural organization principles at the population, individual neuron and synapse levels."

The correlation between the resting state fMRI activity traces of different brain regions indicates to what extent they are functionally connected. rs-fMRI data typically consists of a matrix of correlations, also denoted as functional correlations, between regions in the brain. Visualization is required for a good understanding of the data. Several well-known representations have been used to visualize this type of data, including multi-dimensional scaling, spring embedding, scatter plots and network visualization. None of these methods provide the ability to show the functional correlation in relation to the anatomical distance and position of the regions, while preserving the ability to quickly identify outliers in the data. In this paper, a visual analysis application is presented that overcomes this limitation by combining the strengths of the two-dimensional representations with three dimensional network and iso-surfacing visualizations. We show how the application facilitates rs-fMRI connectivity research by means of a case study evaluation."

    "abstract": "Non-invasive imaging techniques become more and more important as diagnostic tools for the assessment of coronary heart disease (CHD). While CT is widely applied for the inspection of the coronary arteries, the state of myocardial tissue is normally analyzed with MRI or nuclear imaging methods such as PET or SPECT. The effect of late enhancement, the accumulation of contrast agent in defective tissue, is used to assess tissue viability with MR imaging. Studies have shown, that this effect can be observed for iodine based contrast agents, which are used for CT coronary artery imaging, as well. Thus the goal of this work is the development of segmentation and visualization methods, which allow a combined inspection of the coronary arteries and the viability of the corresponding myocardial tissue. We therefore present a new segmentation method for the analysis of CT late enhancement images and the integration with methods for the inspection of the coronary arteries. In preliminary tests by a radiologist, the methods are applied to 4 datasets to compare the segmentation with the reference method, test the combined inspection for data with a known relation between infarction and supplying artery and test the general applicability to patient data. The preliminary results are promising, and further studies will focus on the evaluation of the segmentation method as well as on the clinical benefit through the combined analysis."

    "abstract": "For the evaluation of medical visualizations, a ground truth is often missing. Therefore, the evaluation of medical visualizations is often restricted to qualitative comparisons w.r.t user preferences but neglects more objective measures such as accuracies or task completion times. In this work, we provide a pipeline with statistical tests for the evaluation of the user performance within an experimental setup. We demonstrate the adaption of the pipeline for the specific example of cerebral aneurysm surface visualization. Therefore, we developed three visualization techniques to compare the aneurysm volumes. Then, we present a single-factor, within-subject user study, which allows for the evaluation of these visualization techniques as well as the identification of the most suitable one. The evaluation includes a qualitative as well as a comprehensive quantitative analysis to determine statistically significant differences. As a result, a color-coded map surface view is identified as best suited to depict the aneurysm volume changes. The presentation of the different stages of the evaluation pipeline allows for an easy adaption to other application areas of medical visualization. As a result, we provide orientation to enrich qualitative evaluations by the presented quantitative analyses."

    "abstract": "Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) is one of the most commonly used modalities in the diagnosis of cerebrovascular diseases like ischemic strokes. Usually, the anatomy of interest in ischemic stroke cases is the Circle of Willis and its peripherals, the cerebral arteries, as these vessels are the most prominent candidates for occlusions. The diagnosis of occlusions in these vessels remains challenging, not only because of the large amount of surrounding vessels but also due to the large number of anatomical variants. We propose a fully automated image processing and visualization pipeline, which provides a full segmentation and modelling of the cerebral arterial tree for CTA data. The model itself enables the interactive masking of unimportant vessel structures e.g. veins like the Sinus Sagittalis, and the interactive planning of shortest paths meant to be used to prepare further treatments like a mechanical thrombectomy. Additionally, the algorithm automatically labels the cerebral arteries (Middle Cerebral Artery left and right, Anterior Cerebral Artery short, Posterior Cerebral Artery left and right) detects occlusions or interruptions in these vessels. The proposed pipeline does not require a prior non-contrast CT scan and achieves a comparable segmentation appearance as in a Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA)."

    "abstract": "Biomedical data can be classified according to different taxonomies. Understanding the relationships between different data categories is essential for an in-depth knowledge of the data. We present a volume rendering system aimed at outlining structural relationships between different classification criteria of a biomedical voxel model. The system clusterizes the model into subsets of voxels sharing the same classification criteria. It constructs a labelled voxel model storing for each voxel an identifier of its associated cluster. We represent the classification space as a graph and we render it in the application interface. This way, clinicians can specify their visualization queries by selecting nodes of the graph and boolean operations between them. Given a rendering query, the system computes a transfer function on the labelled voxel model domain. This transfer function, together with the original voxel model and the labelled voxel model, are used during rendering to visualize the selected data more or less colored according to level of the graph at which they have been selected, and contextualized with the other parts of the model to which they are related. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on several biomedical datasets."

This highly complex task can be simulated by several software tools, providing the biochemists with possible ligand trajectories, which have to be subsequently explored and evaluated for their biochemical relevance. This paper focuses on aiding this exploration process by introducing DockVis visual analysis tool. DockVis operates primarily with the multivariate output data from one of the latest available tools for molecular docking, CaverDock. CaverDock output consists of several parameters and properties, which have to be subsequently studied and understood. DockVis was designed in tight collaboration with protein engineers using the CaverDock tool. However, we believe that the concept of DockVis can be extended to any other molecular docking tool providing the users with corresponding computation results."

    "abstract": "The spleen is one of the organs, where the micro-structure and the function on that level are not completely understood. It was for example only recently found that is has an open circulation, which distinguishes it from all other organs. Imaging the complete vascular network from the arteries to open-ended capillaries would greatly facilitate research in this area. The structure of such tissue is best uncovered using immunehistological staining. This can however only be applied to thin tissue sections and larger structures span several slices. Due to the deformation induced when cutting the specimen, standard registration algorithms cannot be used to merge the images into a volume. We propose a specialized matching algorithm to robustly determine corresponding regions in the images. After a rigid alignment of the scans, we use a cubic B-spline to deform and align the images. During this process we minimize the total deformation to produce as accurate results as possible."

It is often delegated to an assistant or performed directly by the physician with an interaction device wrapped in a sterile plastic sheath. This process is time-consuming and inefficient. To address this challenge, we introduce a gesture-based interface for a medical image viewer that is completely touchlessly controlled by the Myo Gesture Control Armband (Thalmic Labs). Based on a clinical requirement analysis, we propose a minimal gesture set to support basic interaction tasks with radiological images and 3D models. We conducted two user studies and a clinical test to evaluate the interaction device and our new gesture control interface. The evaluation results prove the applicability of our approach and provide an important foundation for future research in physician-machine interaction."

Such research requires extensive analysis and comparison of blood flow data within and between different patient cohorts representing different age groups, genders and pathologies. However, a direct comparison between large numbers of datasets is not feasible due to the complexity of the data. In this paper, we present a novel approach to normalize aortic 4D PC-MRI datasets to enable qualitative and quantitative comparisons. We define normalized coordinate systems for the vessel surface as well as the intravascular volume, allowing for the computation of quantitative measures between datasets for both hemodynamic surface parameters as well as flow or pressure fields. To support the understanding of the geometric deformations involved in this process, individual transformations can not only be toggled on or off, but smoothly transitioned between anatomically faithful and fully abstracted states. In an informal interview with an expert radiologist, we confirm the usefulness of our technique. We also report on initial findings from exploring a database of 138 datasets consisting of both patient and healthy volunteers."

It eventually produces a point cloud, which needs to be voxelised to produce volume data that can be used with conventional medical image software. However, resulting voxel data is noisy. In our test case with 6,400 points the normalised cross-correlation (NCC) between the reference and the reconstruction is 85.53%; with 25,600 points it is 93.60%. This paper introduces a more robust 3D voxelisation method based on implicit modelling using metaballs to overcome this limitation. With metaballs, the NCC with 6,400 points increases up to 92.21%; and up to 96.26% with 25,600 points."

For this reason, there is much interest in the accurate, reproducible delineation of this region of interest (ROI) in structural MR images. Here, both current and novel MR hippocampal segmentation methods are presented and evaluated: Two versions of FMRIB's Integrated Registration and Segmentation Tool (FIRST and FIRSTv2), Freesurfer's Aseg (FS), Classifier Fusion (CF) and a Fast Marching approach (FMClose). Segmentation performance on two clinical datasets is assessed according to three common measures: Dice coefficient, false positive rate (FPR) and false negative rate (FNR). The first clinical dataset contains 9 normal controls (NC) and 8 highly-atrophied AD patients, whilst the second is a collection of 16 NC and 16 bipolar (BP) patients. Results show that CF outperforms all other methods on the BPSA data, whilst FIRST and FIRSTv2 perform best on the CMA data, with average Dice coefficients of 0.81+-0.01, 0.85+-0.00 and 0.85+-0.01, respectively. This work brings to light several strengths and weaknesses of the evaluated hippocampal segmentation methods, of utmost importance for robust and accurate segmentation in the presence of specific and substantial pathology."

White matter fiber tractography from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is, in general, visualized as 3D lines or tubes together with 2D anatomical MR slices or surfaces. However, determining the exact location of the fiber tracts in their surrounding anatomy is still unsolved. Rendering the embedding anatomy of fiber tracts provides new insight into the exact spatial arrangement of fiber bundles, their spatial relation, and tissue properties surrounding the tracts [SSA*08]. We propose a virtual Klingler dissection method of brain white matter creating curved dissection surfaces locally parallel to user specified fiber bundles. To achieve this effect in computer visualization, we create free-form clipping surfaces that align with the fiber structure of the brain and texture these according to structures they intersect or align with. An optimal view on the naturally embedding curved anatomical structure of the surrounding tissue enables the study of location and course of fiber bundles and the specific relation between different fiber systems in the brain. Indication of the local fiber orientation on the dissected brain surface leads to a representation of both, structural and directional information. The system is demonstrated on a human DTI dataset illustrating the dissection of the sub-insular white matter."

    "abstract": "Tracked medical ultrasound allows for cost-effective and radiation-free imaging of anatomy featuring a very high spatial resolution. To overcome the limitations of the small field-of-view, sonographers can acquire multiple adjacent sweeps and compound them into a single volumetric representation. However, due to the inherent local and non-uniform compression of the underlying anatomy (caused by the ultrasound probe) the adjacent sweeps often exhibit poor alignment and discontinuities. We propose a novel decompression model to compensate for probe pressure related artifacts. It incorporates domain knowledge of the global acquisition pattern for regularization and allows for seamless stitching of multiple overlapping 3D freehand sweeps into one volume. The resulting extended field-of-view visualization provides the clinician with spatial context so that the relationship between individual features are easier to understand. Our experiments show that the resulting extended field-of-view reconstructions have a superior image quality in terms of alignment and continuity of the visible anatomy compared to the original acquisitions. Comparison to ground truth MRI data demonstrates the plausibility of our non-rigid decompression model."

    "abstract": "Animation is a potentially powerful instrument to convey complex information with movements, smooth transitions between different states that employ the strong human capabilities to perceive and interpret motion. Animation is a natural choice to display time-dependent data where the dynamic nature of the data is mapped to a kind of video (temporal animation). Clipping planes may be smoothly translated and object transparency adapted to control visibility and further support emphasis of spatial relations, e.g. around a tumor. Animation, however, may also be employed for static data, e.g. to move a camera along a predefined path to convey complex anatomical structures. Virtual endoscopy, where the virtual camera is moved inside an air-filled or fluid-filled structure is a prominent example for these non-temporal animations. Animations, however, are complex visualizations that may depict a larger number of changes in a short period of time. Thus, they need to be assessed in their capability to actually convey information. In this paper, we give a survey of temporal and non-temporal animated visualizations focussed on medical applications and discuss the research potential that arises. To be employed more widely, cognitive limitations, e.g. change blindness, need to be considered. The reduction of complexity in temporal animations is an essential topic to enable the detection and interpretation of changes. Emphasis techniques may guide the user's attention and improve the perception of essential features. Finally, interaction beyond the typical video recorder functionality is considered. Although our focus is medicine, the discussion of a research agenda is partially based on cartography, where animation is widely used."

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound imaging and visualization is often used in medical diagnostics, especially in prenatal screening. Screening the development of the fetus is important to assess possible complications early on. State of the art approaches involve taking standardized measurements to compare them with standardized tables. The measurements are taken in a 2D slice view, where precise measurements can be difficult to acquire due to the fetal pose. Performing the analysis in a 3D view would enable the viewer to better discriminate between artefacts and representative information. Additionally making data comparable between different investigations and patients is a goal in medical imaging techniques and is often achieved by standardization. With this paper, we introduce a novel approach to provide a standardization method for 3D ultrasound fetus screenings. Our approach is called ''The Vitruvian Baby'' and incorporates a complete pipeline for standardized measuring in fetal 3D ultrasound. The input of the method is a 3D ultrasound screening of a fetus and the output is the fetus in a standardized T-pose. In this pose, taking measurements is easier and comparison of different fetuses is possible. In addition to the transformation of the 3D ultrasound data, we create an abstract representation of the fetus based on accurate measurements. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approach on simulated data where the ground truth is known."

It can be used to facilitate the learning of anatomy by medicine and sports students, and for the general public to discover human anatomy in action. We illustrate our approach using the example of knee flexion and extension by visualizing the knee muscle activation prediction with agonist and antagonist co-contraction. Muscle activation data for specified movements is first measured during a preliminary phase. The user is then tracked in real time, and its motion is analyzed to recognize the motion being performed. This is used to efficiently evaluate muscle activation by interpolating the activation data stored in tables. The visual feedback consists of a user-specific 3D avatar created by deforming a reference model and animated using the tracking. Muscle activation is visualized using colored lines of action or 3D meshes. This work was made possible by the collaboration of three complementary labs specialized in computer-aided medical intervention, computer graphics and biomechanics."

    "abstract": "Perfusion data characterize the regional blood flow in human tissue. In the diagnosis of the Coronary Heart Disease, they are acquired to detect hypoperfused regions of the myocardium (heart muscle) at an early stage or to evaluate the hemodynamical relevance of a known pathologic vessel narrowing. For each voxel in the data, a time-intensity curve describes the enhancement of a contrast agent. Parameters derived from these curves characterize the regional perfusion and have to be integrated for diagnosis. The diagnostic evaluation of this multi-field data is challenging and time-consuming due to its complexity. We tackle this problem by developing a glyph-based integrated visualization of perfusion parameters in 3D-space with the patient-individual ventricular anatomy as context information. Besides the assessment of myocardial perfusion, current cardiac imaging technology allows for the investigation of myocardial contractility as well as for the detection of non-viable tissue. The combined inspection of these data supports diagnosis finding and therapy planning by allowing for the discrimination of healthy, hypoperfused and non-viable tissue as well as between non-viable and temporarily inactive tissue. To facilitate such an inspection, we apply registration methods that cope with differences in orientation and coverage between these three datasets. We enhance the glyph-based visualization of perfusion parameters by integrating parameters describing the myocardial contractility and viability."

    "abstract": "International standards require close monitoring of distress of animals undergoing laboratory experiments in order to minimize the stress level and allow choosing minimally stressful procedures for the experiments. Currently, one of the the best established severity assessment procedures is the mouse grimace scale (MGS), a protocol in which images of the animals are taken and scored by assessing five key visual features that have been shown to be highly correlated with distress and pain. While proven to be highly reliable, MGS assessment is currently a time-consuming task requiring manual video processing for key frame extraction and subsequent expert grading. Additionally, due to the the high per-picture expert time required, MGS scoring is performed on a small number of selected frames from a video. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a method for fully automated real-time MGS scoring of orbital eye tightening, one of the five sub-scores. We define and evaluate the method which is centered around a set of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and allows live continuous MGS assessment of a mouse in real time. We additionally describe a multithreaded client-server architecture with a graphical user interface that allows convenient use of the developed method for simultaneous real-time MGS scoring of several animals."

    "abstract": "Fast and reliable methods for predicting and monitoring in-vivo bone strength are of great importance for hip joint replacement. To avoid adaptive remodeling with cortical thinning and increased porosity of the bone due to stress shielding, in a preoperative planning process the optimal implant design, size, and position has to be determined. This process involves interactive implant positioning within the bone as well as simulation and visualization of the stress within bone and implant due to exerting forces. In this paper, we present a prototype of such a visual analysis tool, which, to our best knowledge, provides the first computational steering environment for optimal implant selection and positioning. This prototype considers patient-specific biomechanical properties of the bone to select the optimal implant design, size, and position according to the prediction of individual load transfer from the implant to the bone. We have developed a fast and stable multigrid finite-element solver for hexahedral elements, which enables interactive simulation of the stress distribution within the bone and the implant. By utilizing a real-time GPU-method to detect elements that are covered by the moving implant, we can automatically generate computational models from patient-specific CT scans in real-time, and we can instantly feed these models into the simulation process. Hardware-accelerated volume ray-casting, which is extended by a new method to accurately visualize sub-hexahedron implant boundaries, provides a new quality of orthopedic surgery planning."

We present an application-driven approach, which solves the visibility issues arising from the simultaneous presentation of probabilistic tractograms and anatomical context. The tractogram (a scalar field indicating a connectivity score between voxels) is visualized by nested surface layers, providing an overview of long-range connectivity. Unique dataset features are reflected by value-based opacity and further enhanced by depth cues. An illustrative, three-dimensional rendering of the cortex complemented with textured slices is provided as anatomical context. The presented methods are based on a detailed requirements analysis with domain experts. Two user studies were performed to evaluate our methods and the techniques were improved based on their feedback. Our methods can be applied to a wide range of data, as they can be adapted to the range and requirements of data very easily."

    "abstract": "4D Flow MRI is a recent promising technology that is able to capture blood flow information within the heart chambers over a cardiac cycle. To accurately study the flow inside the chambers, there is a need for a high quality anatomical reference which can be provided by another scan known as 3D cine MRI (short-axis 3D (multiple 2D slices) cine SSFP). To take advantage of both scans, data fusion can be done using an intensity-based registration. To reduce the impact of noise on the registration result and the chance of misalignment between the organs, defining a region of interest (localization) should be done prior to the registration. Localizing a dataset - especially a time-varying dataset - can be a daunting task since the localization should be provided for all time frames. We design and evaluate different strategies for extending single time frame localization to time varying data in order to register the 4D Flow MRI and 3D cine MRI over the cardiac cycle."

    "abstract": "Biological multi-channel microscopy data are often characterized by a high local entropy and phenotypically identical structures covering only a few pixels and forming disjoint regions spread over, e.g., a cell or a tissue section. Toponome data as an example, comprise a fluorescence image (channel) per protein affinity reagent, and capture the location and spatial distribution of proteins in cells and tissues. Biologists investigate such data using a region-of-interest in an image view and a linked view displaying information aggregated or derived from the channels. The cognitive effort of moving the attention back and forth between the views is immense. We present an approach for the in-place annotation of multi-channel microscopy data in 2D views. We combine dynamic excentric labeling and static necklace maps to cope with the special characteristics of these data. The generated annotations support the biologists in visually exploring multi-channel information directly in its spatial context. A label is generated per unique phenotype included in a flexible, moveable focus region. The labels are organized in a circular fashion around the focus region. On demand, a nested labeling can be generated by displaying a second ring of labels which represents the channels characterizing the focused phenotypes. We demonstrate our approach by toponome data of a rhabdomyosarcoma cell line and a prostate tissue section."

    "abstract": "A challenging problem in biology is the incompleteness of acquired information when visualizing biological phenomena. Structural biology generates detailed models of viruses or bacteria at different development stages, while the processes that relate one stage to another are often not clear. Similarly, the entire life cycle of a biological entity might be available as a quantitative model, while only one structural model is available. If the relation between two models is specified at a lower level of detail than the actual models themselves, the two models cannot be interpolated correctly. We propose a method that deals with the visualization of incomplete data information in the developmental or evolutionary states of biological mesoscale models, such as viruses or microorganisms. The central tool in our approach is visual abstraction. Instead of directly interpolating between two models that show different states of an organism, we gradually forward transform the models into a level of visual abstraction that matches the level of detail of the modeled relation between them. At this level, the models can be interpolated without conveying false information. After the interpolation to the new state, we apply the inverse transformation to the model\u2019's original level of abstraction. To show the flexibility of our approach, we demonstrate our method on the basis of molecular data, in particular data of the HIV virion and the mycoplasma bacterium."

We present a novel method to automatically detect vascular occlusion in non-enhanced computed tomography (NECT) images. Possible hyperdense thrombus candidates are extracted by thresholding and connected component clustering. A set of different features is computed to describe the objects, and a Random Forest classifier is applied to predict them. Thrombus classification yields 98.7% sensitivity with 6.7 false positives per volume, and 91.1% sensitivity with 2.7 false positives per volume. The classifier assigns a clot probability > = 90% for every thrombus with a volume larger than 100 mm3 or with a length above 23 mm, and can be used as a reliable method to detect blood clots."

    "abstract": "We propose an approach to interactively create exploded views of molecular structures with the goal to help domain experts in their design process and provide them with a meaningful visual representation of component relationships. Exploded views are excellently suited to manage visual occlusion of structure components, which is one of the main challenges when visualizing complex 3D data. In this paper, we discuss four key parameters of an exploded view: explosion distance, direction, order, and the selection of explosion components. We propose two strategies, namely the structure-derived exploded view and the interactive free-form exploded view, for computing these four parameters systematically. The first strategy allows scientists to automatically create exploded views by computing the parameters from the given object structures. The second strategy further supports them to design and customize detailed explosion paths through user interaction. Our approach features the possibility to animate exploded views, to incorporate ease functions into these animations and to display the explosion path of components via arrows. Finally, we demonstrate three use cases with various challenges that we investigated in collaboration with a domain scientist. Our approach, therefore, provides interesting new ways of investigating and presenting the design layout and composition of complex molecular structures."

    "abstract": "Modeling of respiratory motion gains in importance within the field of radiation therapy of lung cancer patients. Current modeling approaches are usually confined to intra-patient registration of 3D image data representing the individual patient's anatomy at different breathing phases. We propose an approach to generate a mean motion model of the lung based on thoracic 4D CT data of different patients to extend motion modeling capabilities. Our modeling process consists of two main parts: an intra - subject registration to generate subject - specific motion models and an inter - subject registration to combine these subject - specific motion models into a mean motion model. Further, we present methods to adapt the mean motion model to a patient-specific lung geometry. A first evaluation of the model was done by using the generated mean motion model to predict lung and tumor motion of individual patients and comparing the prediction quality to non - linear registration. Our results show that the average difference in prediction quality (measured by overlap coefficients) between non - linear registration and model - based prediction is approx. 10%. However, the patient - specific registration relies on individual 4D image data, whereas the model - based prediction was obtained without knowledge of the individual breathing dynamics. Results show that the model predicts motion patterns of individual patients generally well and we conclude from our results that such a model has the capability to provide valuable a-priori knowledge in many fields of applications."

In order to understand the development and current state of a single blood vessel or even multiple connected ones, properties of vascular structures have to be analyzed. In this paper we assess the torsion of blood vessels in order to better understand their morphology. The aim of this work is to quantitatively gauge blood vessels by using an automated method that assumes an elliptical blood vessel model. This facilitates using state-of-the-art ellipse fitting algorithms from industrial measuring standards. In order to remove outliers, we propose a self-correcting iterative refitting of ellipses using neighboring information. The torsion information is visually conveyed by connecting the major and minor points of adjacent ellipses. Our final visualization comprises a visual representation of the blood vessel including four bands to outline the torsion."

In vivo research with HIFU systems poses several challenges, therefore, a flexible and fast computer model for HIFU propagation and tissue heating is crucial. We introduce HIFUtk, a visual analytics environment to define, perform, and visualize HIFU simulations. We illustrate the use of HIFUtk by applying HIFU to a rabbit bone model, focusing on two common research questions related to HIFU. The first question concerns the relation between the ablated region shape and the focal point position, and the second one concerns the effect of shear waves on the temperature distribution in bone. These use cases demonstrate that HIFUtk provides a flexible visual analytics environment to investigate the effects of HIFU in various type of materials."

Finding suitable shading algorithms, techniques, and appropriate parameters is time-consuming when practitioners fine-tune them manually. Therefore, we build a shading pipeline using wellknown shading algorithms such as Blinn-Phong, Oren-Nayar, Cook-Torrance, Toon, and extended Lit-Sphere shading with techniques such as the Fresnel effect and screen space ambient occlusion. We interviewed six experts from various domains to find the best combination of shadings for preset combinations that maximize user experience and the applicability in clinical settings."

Automated vessel tracking tools support physicians in vessel analysis and make their workflow time-efficient. We present a fully-automated framework for identification of five main arteries of three different body regions in various field-of-view CTA scans. Our method detects the two common iliac arteries, the aorta and the two common carotid arteries and delivers seed positions in them. After the field-of-view of a CTA scan is identified, artery candidate positions are regressed slice-wise and the best candidates are selected by Naive Bayes classification. Final artery seed positions are detected by picking the most optimal path over the artery classification results from slice to slice. Our method was evaluated on 20 CTA scans with various field-of-views. The high detection performance on different arteries shows its generality and future applicability for automated vessel analysis systems."

    "abstract": "This paper presents a method for the visual quantification of cerebral arteries, known as the Circle of Willis (CoW). The CoW is an arterial structure that is responsible for the brain's blood supply. Dysfunctions of this arterial circle can lead to strokes. The diagnosis relies on the radiologist's expertise and the software tools used. These tools consist of very basic display methods of the volumetric data without support of advanced technologies in medical image processing and visualization. The goal of this paper is to create an automated method for the standardized description of cerebral arteries in stroke patients in order to provide an overview of the CoW's configuration. This novel display provides visual indications of problematic areas as well as straightforward comparisons between multiple patients. Additionally, we offer a pipeline for extracting the CoW from Time-of-Flight Magnetic Resonance Angiography (TOF-MRA) data sets. An enumeration technique for the labeling of the arterial segments is therefore suggested. We also propose a method for detecting the CoW's main supplying arteries by analyzing the coronal, sagittal and transverse image planes of the data sets. We evaluated the feasibility of our visual quantification approach in a study of 63 TOF-MRA data sets and compared our findings to those of three radiologists. The obtained results demonstrate that our proposed techniques are effective in detecting the arteries of the CoW."

    "abstract": "When learning ultrasound (US) imaging, trainees must learn how to recognize structures, interpret textures and shapes, and simultaneously register the 2D ultrasound images to their 3D anatomical mental models. Alleviating the cognitive load imposed by these tasks should free the cognitive resources and thereby improve the learning process. We argue that the amount of cognitive load that is required to mentally rotate the models to match the images to them is too large and therefore negatively impacts the learning process. We present a 3D visualization tool that allows the user to naturally move a 2D slice and navigate around a 3D anatomical model. The slice is displayed in-place to facilitate the registration of the 2D slice in its 3D context. Two duplicates are also shown externally to the model; the first is a simple rendered image showing the outlines of the structures and the second is a simulated ultrasound image. Haptic cues are also provided to the users to help them maneuver around the 3D model in the virtual space. With the additional display of annotations and information of the most important structures, the tool is expected to complement the available didactic material used in the training of ultrasound procedures."

Unfortunately, it seems difficult to design a universal tool that is effective for all different structures in biology research. In [WOCH12b], an interactive technique was proposed for extracting neural structures from confocal microscopy data. It uses a dual-stroke paint brush to select desired structures directly from volume visualizations. However, the technique breaks down when it was applied to selecting densely packed structures with condensed shapes, such as nuclei from zebrafish eye development research. We collaborated with biologists studying zebrafish eye development and adapted the paint brush tool for real-time nucleus selection from volume data. The morphological diffusion algorithm used in the previous paint brush is restricted to gradient descending directions for improved nucleus boundary definition. Occluded seeds are removed using backward ray-casting. The adapted paint brush is then used in tracking cell movements in a time sequence dataset of a developing zebrafish eye."

    "abstract": "Nowadays, computer-aided diagnosis is widely used in the analysis of cardiac image data. Especially, for the investigation of the dynamic behavior of the heart, automated analysis tools for 4D data sets have been developed. A small set of descriptors of the heart s dynamics are established and used in the clinical routine. However, there exists a whole lot more of such parameters that can be extracted by analyzing 4D data sets. But, many of them are not used due to several reasons: time-consuming computation, no intuitive meaning, little clinical relevance, etc.. In this work we propose a novel descriptor for the dynamic behavior of the heart that can easily be computed from 4D data sets. It describes to which extent the heart exhibits an asynchronous movement. This novel descriptor ASYNCHRONISM is based on the already established measures WALL MOTION and WALL THICKENING, but reveals new, valuable information that is not available when relying only upon the two aforementioned parameters. The ASYNCHRONISM has an intuitive meaning, since it corresponds to the clinical classification scheme of wall motion abnormalities. Beyond its computation we present in this work also methods for its visualization as well as first preliminary results for 4D cardiac magnetic resonance image data."

This segmentation is an important step for automation of the intraoperative registration which relies on vessel structures visible in contrast enhanced CT and ultrasound volumes. This paper describes the problems that arise when using B-mode ultrasound for segmentation of vessels and how they can be solved by introducing additional vessel information from color flow imaging. On a total number of 21 patients, our system was applied successfully in 15 cases. For nine randomly chosen patients studied in this paper, our system achieves a 3.45 mm accuracy at points used for registration and 5.01 mm for other landmarks which were not used for the registration process."

    "abstract": "Regional anomalies in the myocardial motion of the left ventricle (LV) are important biomarkers for several cardiac diseases. Myocardial motion can be captured using a velocity-encoded magnetic resonance imaging method called tissue phase mapping (TPM). The acquired data are pre-processed and represented as regional velocities in cylindrical coordinates at three short-axis slices of the left ventricle over one cardiac cycle. We use a spatio-temporal visualization based on a radial layout where the myocardial regions are laid out in an angular pattern similar to the American Heart Association (AHA) model and the temporal dimension increases with increasing radius. To detect anomalies, we compare patient data against the myocardial motion of a cohort of healthy volunteers. For the healthy volunteer cohort, we compute nested envelopes of central regions for the time series of each region and each of the three velocity directions based on the concept of functional boxplots. A quantitative depiction of deviations from the spatio-temporal pattern of healthy heart motion allows for quick detection of regions of interests, which can then be analyzed in more detail by looking at the actual time series. We evaluated our approach in a qualitative user study with imaging and medical experts. The participants appreciated the proposed encoding and considered it a substantial improvement over the current methods."

    "abstract": "Brightness modulation (B-Mode) ultrasound (US) images are used to visualize internal body structures during diagnostic and invasive procedures, such as needle insertion for Regional Anesthesia. Due to patient availability and health risks-during invasive procedures-training is often limited, thus, medical training simulators become a viable solution to the problem. Simulation of ultrasound images for medical training requires not only an acceptable level of realism but also interactive rendering times in order to be effective. To address these challenges, we present a generative method for simulating B-Mode ultrasound images using surface representations of the body structures and geometrical acoustics to model sound propagation and its interaction within soft tissue. Furthermore, physical models for backscattered, reflected and transmitted energies as well as for the beam profile are used in order to improve realism. Through the proposed methodology we are able to simulate, in real-time, plausible view- and depth-dependent visual artifacts that are characteristic in B-Mode US images, achieving both, realism and interactivity."

However, most generative models for medical images focus on image-to-image translation rather than de novo image synthesis. In many clinical applications, image acquisition is multiparametric, i.e. includes contrast-enchanced or diffusion-weighted imaging. We present a generative adversarial network that synthesizes a sequence of temporally consistent contrast-enhanced breast MR image patches. Performance is evaluated quantitatively using the Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance, achieving a minimum FID of 21.03. Moreover, a qualitative human reader test shows that even a radiologist cannot differentiate between real and fake images easily."

TheMS (and associated 3DMA) can be computed as the result of the singularities of a geometric wave propagation simulation. We consider here some of the potential applications of this shape model in the realm of biomedical imaging. We can reconstruct complex object surfaces and make explicit the coarse-scale structures, which are ready-to-use in a number of practical applications, including: morphological measurement for cortex or bone thickness, centerline extraction (curve skeleton) for tracheotomy or colonoscopy, surface partitioning for cortical or anatomical surface classification, as well as registration and matching of shapes of tumors or carpal bones. TheMS permits to automatically and efficiently map an unorganised point cloud, i.e., simple 3D coordinates of point samples, to a coherent surface set and associated approximate MA. The derivedMS is used to further recover significant medium and large scale features, such as surface ridges and main axial symmetries. The radius field of theMS provides an intuitive definition for morphological measurements, while the graph structure made explicit by theMS is useful for shape registration and matching applications."

    "abstract": "Many biochemical and biomedical applications like protein engineering or drug design are concerned with finding functionally similar proteins, however, this remains to be a challenging task. We present a new imaged-based approach for identifying and visually comparing proteins with similar function that builds on the hierarchical clustering of Molecular Surface Maps. Such maps are two-dimensional representations of complex molecular surfaces and can be used to visualize the topology and different physico-chemical properties of proteins. Our method is based on the idea that visually similar maps also imply a similarity in the function of the mapped proteins. To determine map similarity we compute descriptive feature vectors using image moments, color moments, or a Convolutional Neural Network and use them for a hierarchical clustering of the maps. We show that image similarity as found by our clustering corresponds to functional similarity of mapped proteins by comparing our results to the BRENDA database, which provides a hierarchical function-based annotation of enzymes. We also compare our results to the TM-score, which is a similarity value for pairs of arbitrary proteins. Our visualization prototype supports the entire workflow from map generation, similarity computing to clustering and can be used to interactively explore and analyze the results."

    "abstract": "Given diffusion weighted magnetic resonance (dMRI) data, tractography methods may reconstruct estimations of neural connections of the human brain, so called tractograms. Probabilistic tractography algorithms generate a scalar value for each point of the brain, which describes the confidence of an existing structural connection to a predefined seed region. Recently presented Fiber-Stippling is a promising tool to effectively visualize such scalar values on axis aligned cutting planes. However, Fiber-Stippling only works with principal diffusion directions and cannot handle complex tract configurations, such as overlapping or crossing tracts, which are very important to neuroscience. In this work we present an illustrative technique for probabilistic tracts in such configurations, which is based on Fiber-Stippling. Our technique supports multiple diffusion directions as given by high angular resolution diffusion images (HARDI) and hence can visualize crossing tracts, while preserving all of the advantages of Fiber-Stippling. We solve this by visually supporting the stipples, while not altering the original visualization metaphor. Our work is an important contribution to adequate visualization of neuroanatomy, as crossing tracts are a frequent phenomen inside of the human brain. Moreover, our technique may be customized to crossing line fields in general."

    "abstract": "The visual communication of biomedical processes draws from diverse techniques in both visualization and biomedical illustration. However, matching these techniques to their intended audience often relies on practice-based heuristics or narrow-scope evaluations. We present an exploratory study of the criteria that audiences use when evaluating a biomedical process visualization targeted for communication. Designed over a series of expert interviews and focus groups, our study focuses on common communication scenarios of five well-known biomedical processes and their standard visual representations. We framed these scenarios in a survey with participant expertise spanning from minimal to expert knowledge of a given topic. Our results show frequent overlap in abstraction preferences between expert and non-expert audiences, with similar prioritization of clarity and the ability of an asset to meet a given communication objective. We also found that some illustrative conventions are not as clear as we thought, e.g., glows have broadly ambiguous meaning, while other approaches were unexpectedly preferred, e.g., biomedical illustrations in place of data-driven visualizations. Our findings suggest numerous opportunities for the continued convergence of visualization and biomedical illustration techniques for targeted visualization design."

    "abstract": "Frequency distributions (FD) are an important instrument when analyzing and investigating scientific data. In volumetric visualization, for example, frequency distributions visualized as histograms, often assist the user in the process of designing transfer function (TF) primitives. Yet a single point in the distribution can correspond to multiple features in the data, particularly in low-dimensional TFs that dominate time-critical domains such as health care. In this paper, we propose contributions to the area of medical volume data exploration, in particular Computed Tomography (CT) data, based on the decomposition of local frequency distributions (LFD). By considering the local neighborhood utilizing LFDs we can incorporate a measure for neighborhood similarity to differentiate features thereby enhancing the classification abilities of existing methods. This also allows us to link the attribute space of the histogram with the spatial properties of the data to improve the user experience and simplify the exploration step. We propose three approaches for data exploration which we illustrate with several visualization cases highlighting distinct features that are not identifiable when considering only the global frequency distribution. We demonstrate the power of the method on selected datasets."

    "abstract": "Neuroscientists investigate neural circuits in the brain of the common fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster to discover how complex behavior is generated. Hypothesis building on potential connections between individual neurons is an essential step in the discovery of circuits that govern a specific behavior. Overlaps of arborizations of two or more neurons indicate a potential anatomical connection, i.e. the presence of joint synapses responsible for signal transmission between neurons. Obviously, the number of higher order overlaps (i.e. overlaps of three and more arborizations) increases exponentially with the number of neurons under investigation making it almost impossible to precompute quantitative information for all possible combinations. Thus, existing solutions are restricted to pairwise comparison of overlaps as they are relying on precomputed overlap quantification. Analyzing overlaps by visual inspection of more than two arborizations in 2D sections or in 3D is impeded by visual clutter or occlusion. This work contributes a novel tool that complements existing methods for potential connectivity exploration by providing for the first time the possibility to compute and visualize higher order arborization overlaps on the fly and to interactively explore this information in its spatial anatomical context and on a quantitative level. Qualitative evaluation with neuroscientists and non-expert users demonstrated the utility and usability of the tool."

    "abstract": "Medical visualization aims at directly supporting physicians in diagnosis and treatment planning, students and residents in medical education, and medical physicists as well as other medical researchers in answering specific research questions. For assessing whether single medical visualization techniques or entire medical visualization systems are useful in this respect, empirical evaluations involving participants from the target user group are indispensable. The human computer interaction field developed a wide range of evaluation instruments, and the information visualization community more recently adapted and refined these instruments for evaluating (information) visualization systems. However, often medical visualization lacks behind and should pay more attention to evaluation, in particular to evaluations in realistic settings that may assess how visualization techniques contribute to cognitive activities, such as deciding about a surgical strategy or other complex treatment decisions. In this vein, evaluations that are performed over a longer period are promising to study, in order to investigate how techniques are adapted. In this paper, we discuss the evaluation practice in medical visualization based on selected examples and contrast these evaluations with the broad range of existing empirical evaluation techniques. We would like to emphasize that this paper does not serve as a general call for evaluation in medical visualization, but argues that the individual situation must be assessed and that evaluations when they are carried out should be done more carefully."

In toponomics, the toponome is imaged and its inner structure and its semantics are investigated in order to understand how cells encode different functionalities both in health and disease. Toponome imaging results in complex multiparameter data composed of a 3D volume per protein affinity reagent. After imaging, the data is binarized such that 1 encodes protein present and 0 encodes protein absent. Biologists are particularly interested in the clustering of these binary protein patterns and in the distribution of clusters across the cell. We present a volume rendering approach for visualizing all unique protein patterns in 3D. A unique color is dynamically assigned to each pattern such that a sufficient perceptual difference between colors in the current view is guaranteed. We further present techniques for interacting with the view in an exploratory analysis. The biologist may for instance ''peel of'' clusters thereby revealing occluded cell structures. The 3D view is integrated in a multiple coordinated view system. Peeling off clusters or brushing protein patterns in the view updates all other views. We demonstrate the utility of the view with a cell sample containing lymphocytes."

    "abstract": "Recent advances in neuroscience have made it possible to reconstruct all neurons of an entire neural circuit in the larval fruit fly brain from serial electron microscopy image stacks. The reconstructed neurons are morphologically complex 3D graphs whose nodes are annotated with labels representing different types of synapses. Here, we propose a method to draw simplified, yet realistic 2D neuron sketches of insect neurons in order to help biologists formulate hypotheses on neural function at the microcircuit level. The sketches are dendrograms that capture a neuron's branching structure and that preserve branch lengths, providing realistic estimates for distances and signal travel times between synapses. To improve readability of the often densely clustered synapse annotations, synapses are automatically summarized in local clusters of synapses of the same type and arranged to minimize label overlap. We show that two major neuron classes of an olfactory circuit in the larval fruit fly brain can be discriminated visually based on the dendrograms. Unsupervised and supervised data analysis reveals that class discrimination can be performed using morphological features derived from the dendrograms."

Several studies investigated pathologists' behavior but only a few aimed to improve the diagnostic and report process with novel applications. In this work we designed and implemented a first protocol-based CAD viewer supported by visual analytics. The system targets the optimization of the diagnostic workflow in breast cancer diagnosis by means of three image analysis features that belong to the standard grading system (Nottingham Histologic Grade). A pathologist's routine was tracked during the examination of breast cancer tissue slides and diagnostic traces were analyzed from a qualitative perspective. Accordingly, a set of generic requirements was elicited to define the design and the implementation of the CAD-Viewer. A first qualitative evaluation conducted with five pathologists shows that the interface suffices the diagnostic workflow and diminishes the manual effort. We present promising evidence of the usefulness of our CAD-viewer and opportunities for its extension and integration in clinical practice. As a conclusion, the findings demonstrate that it is feasibile to optimize the Nottingham Grading workflow and, generally, the histological diagnosis by integrating computational pathology data with visual analytics techniques."

Integration of this heterogeneous data into a single application is still one of the challenges in the evolution of pathology to a digital practice. While pathologists can perform diagnoses routinely on digital slides only, this is not the case in clinical research. For such purposes, the link between clinicopathological information of patients and images is essential. For example, image analysis researchers who develop automated diagnostic (support) algorithms need to select a representative set of slides to evaluate their methods. To achieve this, they need applications that combine cohort specification, slide image exploration, and selection of suitable images. We present the visualization tool PATHONE, which enables users to perform these steps on a single screen, integrating cohort and WSI selection."

Aneurysm treatment must be carefully examined as there is a risk of fatal outcome during surgery. Aneurysm growth, rupture, and treatment success depend on the interplay of vascular morphology and hemodynamics. Blood flow simulations can obtain the patient-specific hemodynamics. However, analyzing the time-dependent, multi-attribute data is time-consuming and error-prone. ANEULYSIS supports the analysis and visual exploration of aneurysm data including morphological and hemodynamic attributes. Since this is an interdisciplinary process involving both physicians and fluid mechanics experts, we provide a redundancy-free management of aneurysm data sets according to a consistent structure. Major contributions are an improved analysis of morphological aspects, simultaneous evaluation of wall- and flow-related characteristics as well as multiple attributes on the vessel wall, the assessment of mechanical wall processes as well as an automatic classification of the internal flow behavior. It was designed and evaluated in collaboration with domain experts who confirmed its usefulness and clinical necessity."

Our framework comprises on-the-fly reconstruction of the corresponding vessel surface and subsequent local surface compression and expansion. Additionally, we allow the enrichment with an illustrative, plausible blood flow visualization. Our framework is designed for medical educators and students to support anatomy and pathology education. Anatomy educators can realize the step-by-step process of creating and explaining complex spatial relationships of interlinked vascular structures and blood flow behavior. Students can view this process and explore the created structures, which helps them in reproducing and memorizing them. To create a surface model based on the sketched centerlines, we employ implicit surfaces. This allows for easy adding, editing, and removing vessel branches and achieve continuous surfaces with smooth transitions at branchings. The blood flow can be interactively added and is realized with a topology-aware particle simulation. We qualitatively evaluated our framework and demonstrate the applicability and usability of our approach."

    "abstract": "In the process of designing drugs it is crucial to perform various analyses of cavities and channels in protein molecules. Chemists also require that more than one ideal channel be computed in a static protein molecule. Three basic approaches for computation of more than a single channel were introduced in recent publications. However, these approaches have several disadvantages. In this paper we propose a new adaptive method for computation of more channels. This new method is piloted on a real data and results are compared with channels identified by chemists as relevant. The comparison indicates that this method is a significant improvement over previous methods, as the method computes less number of similar and biochemically insignificant channels."

    "abstract": "Craniotomy is a procedure where neurosurgeons open the patient's skull to gain direct access to the brain. The craniotomy's position defines the access path from the skull surface to the tumour and, consequently, the healthy brain tissue to be removed to reach the tumour. This is a complex procedure where a neurosurgeon is required to mentally reconstruct spatial relations of important brain structures to avoid removing them as much as possible. We propose a visualisation method using Augmented Reality to assist in the planning of a craniotomy. The goal of this study is to visualise important brain structures aligned with the physical position of the patient and to allow a better perception of the spatial relations of the structures. Additionally, a heat map was developed that is projected on top of the skull to provide a quick overview of the structures between a chosen location on the skull and the tumour. In the experiments, tracking accuracy was assessed, and colour maps were assessed for use in an AR device. Additionally, we conducted a user study amongst neurosurgeons and surgeons from other fields to evaluate the proposed visualisation using a phantom head. Most participants indeed agree that the visualisation can assist in planning a craniotomy and feedback on future improvements towards the clinical scenario was collected."

    "abstract": "We propose a novel method to cut and flatten vascular geometry that results in an intuitive mapping between the 3D and 2D domains. Our approach is fully automatic, and the sole input is the vessel geometry. We aim to simplify parameter analysis on vessel walls for research on vascular disease and computational hemodynamics. We present a use case for the flattening to aid efforts in investigating the pathophysiology of carotid stenoses (vessel constrictions that are a root cause of stroke). To achieve an intuitive mapping, we introduce the notion of natural vessel cuts. They remain on one side of vessel branches, meaning they adhere to the longitudinal direction and thus result in a comprehensible unfolding of the geometry. Vessel branches and endpoints are automatically detected, and a 2D layout configuration is found that retains the original branch layout. We employ a quasi-isometric surface parameterization to map the geometry to the 2D domain as a single patch. The flattened depiction resolves the need for tedious 3D interaction as the whole surface is visible at once.We found this overview particularly beneficial for exploring temporally resolved parameters."

The computational system is a data and command pipeline that links a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner/data and the operator, that includes modules dedicated to image processing and segmentation, structure rendering, trajectory planning and spatial co-registration. The interface was developed with the Unity3D Engine (C#) and deployed and tested on a HoloLens HMD. For ergonomics in the surgical suite, the system was endowed with hands-free interactive manipulation of images and the holographic scene via hand gestures and voice commands. The system was tested in silico using MRI and ultrasound datasets of prostate phantoms. The holographic AR scene rendered by the HoloLens HMD was subjectively found superior to desktop-based volume or 3D rendering with regard to structure detection and appreciation of spatial relationships, planning access paths and manual co-registration of MRI and Ultrasound. By inspecting the virtual trajectory superimposed to rendered structures and MR images, the operator observes collisions of the needle path with vital structures (e.g. urethra) and adjusts accordingly. Holographic AR interfacing with wireless HMD endowed with hands-free gesture and voice control is a promising technology. Studies need to systematically assess the clinical merit of such systems and needed functionalities."

    "abstract": "In radiation therapy, anatomical changes in the patient might lead to deviations between the planned and delivered dose- including inadequate tumor coverage, and overradiation of healthy tissues. Exploring and analyzing anatomical changes throughout the entire treatment period can help clinical researchers to design appropriate treatment strategies, while identifying patients that are more prone to radiation-induced toxicity. We present the Pelvis Runner, a novel application for exploring the variability of segmented pelvic organs in multiple patients, across the entire radiation therapy treatment process. Our application addresses (i) the global exploration and analysis of pelvic organ shape variability in an abstracted tabular view and (ii) the local exploration and analysis thereof in anatomical 2D/3D views, where comparative and ensemble visualizations are integrated. The workflow is based on available retrospective cohort data, which incorporate segmentations of the bladder, the prostate, and the rectum through the entire radiation therapy process. The Pelvis Runner is applied to four usage scenarios, which were conducted with two clinical researchers, i.e., medical physicists. Our application provides clinical researchers with promising support in demonstrating the significance of treatment plan adaptation to anatomical changes."

Firstly we compute a high-dimensional eigenspace using training images, pre-rendered using a standard ray-caster, from a spherically distributed range of camera positions. Then, our system is able to synthesize arbitrary views of the dataset with minimal computation at runtime. We propose a perceptually-adaptive technique to minimize data size and computational complexity whilst preserving perceptual quality of the visualization, in comparison to corresponding ray-cast images. Results indicate that PCA is able to sufficiently learn the full view-independent volumetric model through a finite number of training images and generalize the computed eigenspace to produce high quality images from arbitrary viewpoints, on demand. The approach has potential application in client-server volume visualization or where results of a computationally-complex 3D imaging process need to be interactively visualized on a display device of limited specification."

    "abstract": "Diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography permits the non-invasive reconstruction of major white matter tracts, and is therefore widely used in neurosurgical planning and in neuroscience. However, it is affected by various sources of uncertainty. In this work, we consider the model uncertainty that arises in crossing fiber tractography, from having to select between alternative mathematical models for the estimation of multiple fiber orientations in a given voxel. This type of model uncertainty is a source of instability in dMRI tractography that has not received much attention so far. We develop a mathematical framework to quantify it, based on computing posterior probabilities of competing models, given the local dMRI data. Moreover, we explore a novel strategy for crossing fiber tractography, which computes tracking directions from a consensus of multiple mathematical models, each one contributing with a weight that is proportional to its probability. Experiments on different white matter tracts in multiple subjects indicate that reducing model uncertainty in this way increases the accuracy of crossing fiber tractography."

In multiscale models of viruses or bacteria, there are atoms on the finest level of detail, then amino-acids, secondary structures, macromolecules, up to the compartment level and, in all these levels, elements can be visually distinguished by color. However, currently only single scale coloring schemes are utilized that show information for one particular scale only. We present a novel technology which adaptively, based on the current scale level, adjusts the color scheme to depict or distinguish the currently best visible structural information. We treat the color as a visual resource that is distributed given a particular demand. The changes of the color scheme are seamlessly interpolated between the color scheme from the previous views into a given new one. With such dynamic multi-scale color mapping we ensure that the viewer is able to distinguish structural detail that is shown on any given scale. This technique has been tested by users with an expertise in structural biology and has been overall well received."

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Nearly half of all heart failures occur due to the decline in the performance of the left ventricle (LV). Therefore, early detection, monitoring, and accurate diagnosis of LV pathologies are of critical importance. Usually, global cardiac function parameters are used to assess the cardiac structure and function, although regional abnormalities are important biomarkers of several cardiac diseases. Regional motion of the myocardium, the muscular wall of the LV, can be captured in a non-invasive manner using the velocity-encoded magnetic resonance (MR) imaging method known as Tissue Phase Mapping (TPM). To analyze the complex motion pattern, one typically visualizes for each time step the radial, longitudinal, and circumferential velocities separately according to the American Heart Association (AHA) model, which makes the comprehension of the spatio-temporal pattern an extremely challenging cognitive task. We propose novel spatio-temporal visualization methods for LV myocardial motion analysis with less cognitive load. Our approach uses coordinated views for navigating through the data space. One view visualizes individual time steps, which can be scrolled or animated, while a second view visualizes the temporal evolution using the radial layout of a polar plot for the time dimension. Different designs for visual encoding were considered in both views and evaluated with medical experts to demonstrate and compare their effectiveness and intuitiveness for detecting and analyzing regional abnormalities."

    "abstract": "Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a brain disease that is diagnosed and monitored extensively through MRI scans. One of the criteria is the appearance of so-called brain lesions. The lesions show up on MRI scans as regions with elevated or reduced contrast compared to the surrounding healthy tissue. Understanding the complex interplay of contrast, location and shape in images from multiple modalities from 2D MRI slices is challenging. Advanced visualization of appearance- and location-related features of lesions would help researchers in defining better disease characterization through MS research. Since a permanent cure is not possible in MS and medication-based disease modification is a common treatment path, providing better visualizations would strengthen research which investigates the effect of white matter lesions. Here we present an advanced visualization solution that supports analysis from multiple imaging modalities acquired in a clinical routine examination. The solution holds potential for enabling researchers to have a more intuitive perception of lesion features. As an example for enhancing the analytic possibilities, we demonstrate the benefits of lesion projection using both Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and gradient-based techniques. This approach enables users to assess brain structures across individuals as the atlas-based analysis provides 3D anchoring and labeling of regions across a series of brain scans from the same participant and across different participants. The projections on the brain surface also enable researchers to conduct detailed studies on the relationship between cognitive disabilities and location of lesions. This allows researchers to correlate lesions to Brodmann areas and related brain functions. We realize the solutions in a prototype application that supports both DTI and structural data. A qualitative evaluation demonstrates that our approach supports MS researchers by providing new opportunities for MS research."

    "abstract": "Blood flow simulations play an important role for the understanding of vascular diseases, such as aneurysms. However, analysis of the resulting flow patterns, especially comparisons across patient groups, are challenging. Typically, the hemodynamic analysis relies on trial and error inspection of the flow data based on pathline visualizations and surface renderings. Visualizing too many pathlines at once may obstruct interesting features, e.g., embedded vortices, whereas with too little pathlines, particularities such as flow characteristics in aneurysm blebs might be missed. While filtering and clustering techniques support this task, they require the pre-computation of pathlines densely sampled in the space-time domain. Not only does this become prohibitively expensive for large patient groups, but the results often suffer from undersampling artifacts. In this work, we propose the usage of evolutionary algorithms to reduce the overhead of computing pathlines that do not contribute to the analysis, while simultaneously reducing the undersampling artifacts. Integrated in an interactive framework, it efficiently supports the evaluation of hemodynamics for clinical research and treatment planning in case of cerebral aneurysms. The specification of general optimization criteria for entire patient groups allows the blood flow data to be batch-processed. We present clinical cases to demonstrate the benefits of our approach especially in presence of aneurysm blebs. Furthermore, we conducted an evaluation with four expert neuroradiologists. As a result, we report advantages of our method for treatment planning to underpin its clinical potential."

The benefits of visualization of digital objects in XR mainly arise from enhanced depth perception due to the stereoscopic nature of XR head mounted devices. With the added depth dimension, XR is in a prime position to convey complex information and support tasks where 3D information is important. In order to inform the development of novel XR applications in the biology and medicine domain, we present a survey which reviews the neuroscientific basis underlying the immersive features of XR. To make this literature more accessible to the visualization community, we first describe the basics of the visual system, highlighting how visual features are combined to objects and processed in higher cortical areas with a special focus on depth vision. Based on state of the art findings in neuroscience literature related to depth perception, we provide several recommendations for developers and designers. Our aim is to aid development of XR applications and strengthen development of tools aimed at molecular visualization, medical education, and surgery, as well as inspire new application areas."

Additionally, MSA quality analysis is often completely ignored, especially by non-expert users, due to the lack of tools for the visual comparison and the intuitive quality assessment of alignments. In this paper, we present an interactive visual approach to simultaneously assess the quality of multiple alternative MSAs of the same set of sequences. We provide a direct assessment of the alignment quality using different highlighting techniques in combination with automatic quality measures and editing capabilities.

Cell illustrations and animations are used for scientific as well as for educational purposes. Unfortunately, there exist only few tools to support the cell modeling process on a molecular level. A major problem is the immense intracellular size variation between relatively large mesoscopic cell components and small molecular membrane patches. This makes both modeling and visualization of whole cells a challenging task. In this paper we propose Membrane Mapping as an interactive tool for combining the mesoscopic and molecular level. Based on instantly computed local parameterizations we map patches of molecular membrane structures onto user-selected regions of cell components. By designing an efficient and GPU-friendly mapping technique, our approach allows to visualize and map pre-computed molecular dynamics simulations of membrane patches to mesoscopic structures in real-time. This enables the visualization of whole cells on a mesoscopic level with an interactive magnifier tool for inspecting their molecular structure and dynamic behavior."

    "abstract": "Ray-based simulations have been shown to generate impressively realistic ultrasound images in interactive frame rates. Recent efforts used GPU-based surface ray-tracing to simulate complex ultrasound interactions such as multiple reflections and refractions. These methods are restricted to perfectly specular reflections (i.e., following only a single reflective/refractive ray), whereas real tissue exhibits roughness of varying degree at tissue interfaces, causing partly diffuse reflections and refractions. Such surface interactions are significantly more complex and can in general not be handled by such deterministic ray-tracing approaches. However, they can be efficiently computed by Monte-Carlo sampling techniques, where many ray paths are generated with respect to a probability distribution. In this paper we introduce Monte-Carlo ray-tracing for ultrasound. This enables the realistic simulation of ultrasound interactions such as soft shadows and fuzzy reflections. We discuss how to properly weight the contribution of each ray path in order to simulate the behavior of a beamformed ultrasound signal. Tracing many individual rays per transducer element is easily parallelizable on modern GPUs, as opposed to previous approaches based on recursive binary ray-tracing."

    "abstract": "The use of electric wheelchairs is inherently risky, as collisions due to lack of control can result in injury for the user, but also potentially for other pedestrians. Introducing new users to powered chairs via virtual reality (VR) provides one possible solution, as it eliminates the risks inherent to the real world during training. However, traditionally simulator technology has been too expensive to make VR a financially viable solution. Also, current simulators lack the natural interaction possible in the real world, limiting their operational value. We present the early stages of a VR, electric wheelchair simulator built using low-cost, consumer level gaming hardware. The simulator makes use use of the the Leap Motion, to provide a level of interaction with the virtual world which has not previously been demonstrated in wheelchair training simulators. Furthermore, the Occulous Rift provides an immersive experience suitable for our training application."

    "abstract": "Projections of complex anatomical or biological structures from 3D to 2D are often used by visualization and domain experts to facilitate inspection and understanding. Representing complex structures, such as organs or molecules, in a simpler 2D way often requires less interaction, while enabling comparability. However, the most commonly employed projection methods introduce size or shape distortions, in the resulting 2D representations. While simple projections display known distortion patterns, more complex projection algorithms are not easily predictable.We propose the VisualFlatter, a visual analysis tool that enables visualization and domain experts to explore and analyze projection-induced distortions, in a structured way. Our tool provides a way to identify projected regions with semantically relevant distortions and allows users to comparatively analyze distortion outcomes, either from alternative projection methods or due to different setups through the projection pipeline. The user is given the ability to improve the initial projection configuration, after comparing different setups. We demonstrate the functionality of our tool using four scenarios of 3D to 2D projections, conducted with the help of domain or visualization experts working on different application fields. We also performed a wider evaluation with 13 participants, familiar with projections, to assess the usability and functionality of the Visual Flatter."

    "abstract": "Cardiac 4D PC-MRI acquisitions gained increasing clinical interest in recent years. They allow to non-invasively obtain extensive information about patient-specific hemodynamics and thus have a great potential to improve the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. A dataset contains time-resolved, three-dimensional blood flow directions and strengths, facilitating comprehensive qualitative and quantitative data analysis. The quantification of measures such as stroke volumes helps to assess the cardiac function and monitor disease progression. Qualitative analysis allows to investigate abnormal flow characteristics, such as vortices, that are correlated to different pathologies. Processing the data comprises complex image processing methods as well as flow analysis and visualization. In this work, we mainly focus on the aorta. We provide an overview from data measurement and preprocessing to current visualization and quantification methods so that other researchers can quickly catch up with the topic and take on new challenges to further investigate the potential of 4D PC-MRI."

    "abstract": "The evaluation of spatial relationships between anatomic structures is a major task in surgical planning. Surface models generated from medical image data (intensity, binary) are often used for visualization and 3D measurement of extents and distances between neighboring structures. In applications for intervention or radiation treatment planning, the surface models should exhibit a natural look (referring to smoothness of the surface), but also be accurate. Smoothing algorithms allow to reduce artifacts from mesh generation, but often degrade accuracy. In particular, relevant features may be removed and distances between adjacent structures get changed. Thus, we present a modification to common mesh smoothing algorithms, which allows to focus the smoothing effect directly to previously identified staircase artifacts. This allows to preserve non-artifact features. The approach has been applied to various data to demonstrate the suitability for different anatomical shapes. The results are compared to the ones of standard uniform mesh smoothing algorithms and are evaluated regarding smoothness and accuracy with respect to the application within surgical planning."

    "abstract": "Cerebral aneurysms are a vascular dilatation induced by a pathological change of the vessel wall and often require treatment to avoid rupture. Therefore, it is of main interest, to estimate the risk of rupture, to gain a deeper understanding of aneurysm genesis, and to plan an actual intervention, the surface morphology and the internal blood flow characteristics. Visual exploration is primarily used to understand such complex and variable type of data. Since the blood flow data is strongly influenced by the surrounding vessel morphology both have to be visually combined to efficiently support visual exploration. Since the flow is spatially embedded in the surrounding aneurysm surface, occlusion problems have to be tackled. Thereby, a meaningful visual reduction of the aneurysm surface that still provides morphological hints is necessary. We accomplish this by applying an adapted illustrative rendering style to the aneurysm surface. Our contribution lies in the combination and adaption of several rendering styles, which allow us to reduce the problem of occlusion and avoid most of the disadvantages of the traditional semi-transparent surface rendering, like ambiguities in perception of spatial relationships. In interviews with domain experts, we derived visual requirements. Later, we conducted an initial survey with 40 participants (13 medical experts of them), which leads to further improvements of our approach."

    "abstract": "Molecular visualizations are a principal tool for analyzing the results of biochemical simulations. With modern GPU ray casting approaches it is only possible to render several millions of atoms at interactive frame rates unless advanced acceleration methods are employed. But even simplified cell models of whole-cell simulations consist of at least several billion atoms. However, many instances of only a few different proteins occur in the intracellular environment, which is beneficial in order to fit the data into the graphics memory. One model is stored for each protein species and rendered once per instance. The proposed method exploits recent algorithmic advances for particle rendering and the repetitive nature of intracellular proteins to visualize dynamic results from mesoscopic simulations of cellular transport processes. We present two out-of-core optimizations for the interactive visualization of data sets composed of billions of atoms as well as details on the data preparation and the employed rendering techniques. Furthermore, we apply advanced shading methods to improve the image quality including methods to enhance depth and shape perception besides non-photorealistic rendering methods."

    "abstract": "Efficacy of radiotherapy treatment depends on the specific characteristics of tumorous tissues. For the determination of these characteristics, clinical practice uses Dynamic Contrast Enhanced (DCE) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). DCE-MRI data is acquired and modeled using pharmacokinetic modeling, to derive per voxel a set of parameters, indicative of tissue properties. Different pharmacokinetic modeling approaches make different assumptions, resulting in parameters with different distributions. A priori, it is not known whether there are significant differences between modeling assumptions and which assumption is best to apply. Therefore, clinical researchers need to know at least how different choices in modeling affect the resulting pharmacokinetic parameters and also where parameter variations appear. In this paper, we introduce iCoCooN: a visualization application for the exploration and analysis of model-induced variations in pharmacokinetic parameters.We designed a visual representation, the Cocoon, by integrating perpendicularly Parallel Coordinate Plots (PCPs) with Cobweb Charts (CCs). PCPs display the variations in each parameter between modeling choices, while CCs present the relations in a whole parameter set for each modeling choice. The Cocoon is equipped with interactive features to support the exploration of all data aspects in a single combined view. Additionally, interactive brushing allows to link the observations from the Cocoon to the anatomy. We conducted evaluations with experts and also general users. The clinical experts judged that the Cocoon in combination with its features facilitates the exploration of all significant information and, especially, enables them to find anatomical correspondences. The results of the evaluation with general users indicate that the Cocoon produces more accurate results compared to independent multiples."

    "abstract": "We present an algorithm for automatic segmentation of the human pelvic bones from CT datasets that is based on the application of a statistical shape model. The proposed method is divided into three steps: 1) The averaged shape of the pelvis model is initially placed within the CT data using the Generalized Hough Transform, 2) the statistical shape model is then adapted to the image data by a transformation and variation of its shape modes, and 3) a final free-form deformation step based on optimal graph searching is applied to overcome the restrictive character of the statistical shape representation. We thoroughly evaluated the method on 50 manually segmented CT datasets by performing a leave-one-out study. The Generalized Hough Transform proved to be a reliable method for an automatic initial placement of the shape model within the CT data. Compared to the manual gold standard segmentations, our automatic segmentation approach produced an average surface distance of 1.2 \u00b1 0.3mm after the adaptation of the statistical shape model, which could be reduced to 0.7\u00b10.3mm using a final free-form deformation step. Together with an average segmentation time of less than 5 minutes, the results of our study indicate that our method meets the requirements of clinical routine."

    "abstract": "The function of proteins is tightly related to their interactions with other molecules. The study of such interactions often requires to track the molecules that enter or exit specific regions of the proteins. This is investigated with molecular dynamics simulations, producing the trajectories of thousands of water molecules during hundreds of thousands of time steps. To ease the exploration of such rich spatio-temporal data, we propose a novel workflow for the analysis and visualization of large sets of water-molecule trajectories. Our solution consists of a set of visualization techniques, which help biochemists to classify, cluster, and filter the trajectories and to explore the properties and behavior of selected subsets in detail. Initially, we use an interactive histogram and a time-line visualization to give an overview of all water trajectories and select the interesting ones for further investigation. Further, we depict clusters of trajectories in a novel 2D representation illustrating the flows of water molecules. These views are interactively linked with a 3D representation where we show individual paths, including their simplification, as well as extracted statistical information displayed by isosurfaces. The proposed solution has been designed in tight collaboration with experts to support specific tasks in their scientific workflows. They also conducted several case studies to evaluate the usability and effectiveness of our new solution with respect to their research scenarios. These confirmed that our proposed solution helps in analyzing water trajectories and in extracting the essential information out of the large amount of input data."

    "abstract": "The presence of tunnels in protein structures substantially influences their reactivity with other molecules. Therefore, studying their properties and changes over time has been in the scope of biochemists for decades. In this paper we introduce a novel approach for the comparative visualization and exploration of ensembles of tunnels. Our goal is to overcome occlusion problems with traditional tunnel representations while providing users a quick way to navigate through the input dataset and to identify potentially interesting tunnels. First, we unfold the input tunnels to a 2D representation enabling to observe the mutual position of amino acids forming the tunnel surface and the amount of surface they influence. These 2D images are subsequently described by image moments commonly used in image processing. This way we are able to detect similarities and outliers in the dataset, which are visualized as clusters in a scatterplot graph. The same coloring scheme is used in the linked bar chart enabling to detect the position of the cluster members over time. These views provide a way to select a subset of potentially interesting tunnels that can be further explored in detail using the 2D unfolded view and also traditional 3D representation. The usability of our approach is demonstrated by case studies conducted by domain experts."

Existing visualization methods, such as curved planar reformation (CPR), reduce the number of images to inspect and, in turn, the time spent per case. However, this task remains time-consuming and exhausting. In this paper, we propose a novel rib unfolding strategy that considers the cross-sectional shape of each rib individually and independently. This leads to shape-adaptive slices through the ribs. By aggregating these slices into a single image, we support radiologists with a concise overview visualization of the entire rib cage for fracture and lesion assessment. We present results of our approach along different cases of rib and spinal fractures as well as lesions. To assess the applicability of our method, we separately evaluated the segmentation (with 954 data sets) and the visualization (with two clinical coaches)."

Traditional deep learning methods typically employ classification error losses, which are highly biased by class imbalance - a situation that naturally arises in medical classification problems.We hereby suggest a novel loss measure that directly maximizes the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), providing an unbiased loss. We validate the proposed model on two mammogram datasets: IMG, comprising of 796 patients, 80 positive (164 images) and 716 negative (1869 images), and the publicly available dataset INbreast. Our results are encouraging, as the proposed scheme achieves an AUC of 0.76 and 0.65 for IMG and INbreast, respectively."

    "abstract": "Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is an established standard for both, medical and industrial volumetric imaging. To compute a 3D volume, multiple 2D x-ray projection images of an object of interest are acquired from different directions. Using the geometric information about the acquisition geometry of each image, the volume is reconstructed. Incorrect geometric information (misalignments) leads to blurring and other artifacts in the resulting reconstruction. The exact acquisition geometry is commonly calculated by the analysis of a scan of a dedicated calibration body (off-line calibration). Such approach requires high repeat accuracy of the scanner mechanics and cannot account for non-systematic deviations. Current methods allowing for misalignment correction without a dedicated phantom, e.g. by iteratively adapting the geometry to minimize the arising artifacts, were developed to work with planar trajectories. It poses a problem for open CBCT systems driving complex trajectories. Therefore, we propose an enhanced method allowing for misalignment correction for general trajectories. We developed a new quality function and a flexible modeling for misalignments. We successfully applied our method to real datasets acquired along planar and non-planar trajectories. The correction with our approach substantially increases the resulting volume quality."

    "abstract": "Evaluation of spatial learning and memory in rodents is commonly carried out using different maze settings such as the Multiple T-Maze. State-of-the-art analysis is primarily based on statistics of quantitative measures stemming from animal trajectories in a maze, e.g. path length or correct decisions made. Currently trajectories themselves are analyzed and evaluated one at a time and comparison of multiple trajectories is a tedious task. The resulting findings may not fully answer complex questions that behavioral researchers encounter as well, e.g., why do animals behave in a certain way or can atypical behaviour be detected? This paper describes an innovative approach on how exploratory analysis for Multiple T-Maze studies can be enhanced through interactive visual analysis. We explain our solution for analyzing a whole ensemble of data at once and support the finding of orientational characteristics and migration patterns within the ensemble. We also abstract the analysis tasks for Multiple TMaze studies and, based on these tasks, we extend a coordinated multiple views system to support the solving of fundamental problems which behavioral researchers face. Besides views of standard charts we deploy a multi-resolution heat map and the Gate-O-Gon, which is a novel visual element. It gives clues on the animals' general movement orientation and distribution of revisited gates, as well as enhances the discovery of patterns in movement and identifying of irregular behavior. Finally we demonstrate the usefulness of the newly proposed approach using a real life data set consisting of 400 Multiple T-Maze runs."

    "abstract": "Segmentation is an essential task in ultrasound image analysis. Recently, the trend in literature is towards incorporation of high-level information, e.g., shape priors, since many low-level segmentation techniques suffer from the characteristics of medical ultrasound images, i.e., speckle noise, scattering artifacts, and shadowing effects. However, the majority of these works implicitly assume an additive Gaussian noise model in ultrasound images, although a strong deviation from this assumption is well known, and the impact of correct physical noise modeling is not examined sufficiently until now. In this paper we investigate the influence of three different noise models from literature using a variational region-based segmentation framework, which allows for the incorporation of both low-level and high-level information. We demonstrate that correct physical noise modeling is of high importance for the computation of accurate segmentation results. The numerical results are validated on real patient datasets from echocardiographic examinations and compared to manual segmentations from echocardiographic experts."

The proposed method has been successfully applied for the reconstruction of human and animal skeletal models. A practical and novel reconstruction methodology has been developed and implemented for the reconstruction of the human foot given a bi-planar X-ray. The purpose of this methodology is to support the parametric generation of human foot biomodels in an automated way. The generated biomodels are employed by simulation tools based on Finite Element Analysis to test the stress factors that the foot is undertaking during its contact with the ground or a footwear sole structure."

    "abstract": "Neuro resection surgery is one of the last resorts when treating epilepsy patients where conservative treatment shows no effect on seizure reduction. However, due to the severity of the surgery, the resection planning has to be as precise as possible in order to avoid harming any critical anatomy. The tight time constraints in clinal routine demand for a highly optimized workflow. In this work, we therefore introduce a novel visualization in order to simplify the navigation in the complex multi-modal neuro data sets and support the clinician with the planning procedure. We propose a schematic electrode map based on a force-directed graph model providing an intuitive overview over the topology of the implanted depth electrode configuration. To further facilitate the planning workflow, our carefully designed electrode glyph supports different scalar, nominal and binary annotations augmenting the view with additional information. Brushing and linking techniques allow for easy mapping of the EEG data to the corresponding anatomy, as well as for straight-forward navigation within the visualization of the anatomical and functional imaging modalities in order to identify the origin and spread of the seizure. Our results show that the proposed graph layouting method successfully removes occlusions of the projected electrodes while maintaining the original topology of the depth electrode configuration. Initial discussions with clinicians and the application to clinical data further show the effectiveness of our methods."

    "abstract": "Phase-Contrast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (PC-MRI) measures volumetric and time-varying blood flow data, unsurpassed in quality and completeness. Such blood-flow data have been shown to have the potential to improve both diagnosis and risk assessment of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) uniquely. Typically PC-MRI data is visualized using stream- or pathlines. However, time-varying aspects of the data, e.g., vortex shedding, breakdown, and formation, are not sufficiently captured by these visualization techniques. Experimental flow visualization techniques introduce a visible medium, like smoke or dye, to visualize flow aspects including time-varying aspects. We propose a framework that mimics such experimental techniques by using a high number of particles. The framework offers great flexibility which allows for various visualization approaches. These include common traditional flow visualizations, but also streak visualizations to show the temporal aspects, and uncertainty visualizations. Moreover, these patient-specific measurements suffer from noise artifacts and a coarse resolution, causing uncertainty. Traditional flow visualizations neglect uncertainty and, therefore, may give a false sense of certainty, which can mislead the user yielding incorrect decisions. Previously, the domain experts had no means to visualize the effect of the uncertainty in the data. Our framework has been adopted by domain experts to visualize the vortices present in the sinuses of the aorta root showing the potential of the framework. Furthermore, an evaluation among domain experts indicated that having the option to visualize the uncertainty contributed to their confidence on the analysis."

    "abstract": "Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) group studies often require the comparison of two groups of 3D diffusion tensor fields. The total number of datasets involved in the study and the multivariate nature of diffusion tensors together make this a challenging process. The traditional approach is to reduce the six-dimensional diffusion tensor to some scalar quantities, which can be analyzed with univariate statistical methods, and visualized with standard techniques such as slice views. However, this provides merely part of the whole story due to information reduction. If to take the full tensor information into account, only few methods are available, and they focus on the analysis of a single group, rather than the comparison of two groups. Simultaneously comparing two groups of diffusion tensor fields by simple juxtaposition or superposition is rather impractical. In this work, we extend previous work by Zhang et al. [ZCH 17] to visually compare two groups of diffusion tensor fields. To deal with the wealth of information, the comparison is carried out at multiple levels of detail. In the 3D spatial domain, we propose a detailson- demand glyph representation to support the visual comparison of the tensor ensemble summary information in a progressive manner. The spatial view guides analysts to select voxels of interest. Then at the detail level, the respective original tensor ensembles are compared in terms of tensor intrinsic properties, with special care taken to reduce visual clutter. We demonstrate the usefulness of our visual analysis system by comparing a control group and an HIV positive patient group."

    "abstract": "A current quest in neurscience is the understanding of how genes, structure and behavior relate to one another. In recent years, big brain-initiatives and consortia have created vast resources of publicly available brain data that can be used by neuroscientists for their own research experiments. This includes microscale connectivity data - brain-network graphs with billions of edges - whose analysis for higher order relations in structural or functional neuroanatomy together with genetic data may reveal novel insights into brain functionality. This creates a need for joint exploration of spatial data, such as gene expression patterns, whole brain gene co-expression correlation, structural and functional connectivities together with neuroanatomical parcellations. Current experimental workflows involve time-consuming manual aggregation and extensive graph theoretical analysis of data from different sources, which rarely provide spatial context to operate continuously on different scales. We propose a web-based framework to explore heterogeneous neurobiological data in an integrated visual analytics workflow. On-demand queries on spatial gene expression and connectivity data enable an interactive dissection of dense network graphs - with of billion-edges on voxel-resolution - in real-time based on their spatial context. In order to take higher order connections between brain regions into account, queries can be executed in a cascading way. Relating data to the hierarchical structure of common anatomical atlases allows experts to quantitatively compare multimodal networks on different scales. Additionally, 3D visualizations have been optimized to accommodate for the domain experts\u2019' need for publishable network figures. We demonstrate the relevance of our approach for neuroscience by exploring social-behavior and memory/learning functional neuroanatomy in mice."

    "abstract": "Function of the heart, including interventricular septum motion, is influenced by respiration and contraction of the heart muscle. Recent real-time magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can acquire multi-cycle cardiac data, which enables the analysis of the variation between heart cycles depending on factors such as physical stress or changes in respiration. There are no normal values for this variation in the literature, and there are no established tools for the analysis and exploration of such multi-cycle data available. We propose an analysis and exploration concept that automatically segments the left and right ventricle, extracts motion parameters and allows to interactively explore the results. We tested the concept using nine real-time MRI data sets, including one subject under increasing stress levels and one subject performing a breathing maneuver. All data sets could be automatically processed and then explored successfully, suggesting that our approach can robustly quantify and explore septum thickness in real-time MRI data."

    "abstract": "Blood flow data from direct measurements (4D flow MRI) or numerical simulations opens new possibilities for the understanding of the development of cardiac diseases. However, before this new data can be used in clinical studies or for diagnosis, it is important to develop a notion of the characteristics of typical flow structures. To support this process we developed a novel blood flow clustering and exploration method. The method builds on the concept of coherent flow structures. Coherence maps for crosssectional slices are defined to show the overall degree of coherence of the flow. In coherent regions the method summarizes the dominant blood flow using a small number of pathline representatives. In contrast to other clustering approaches the clustering is restricted to coherent regions and pathlines with low coherence values, which are not suitable for clustering and thus are not forced into clusters. The coherence map is based on the Finite-time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE). It is created on selected planes in the inflow respective outflow area of a region of interest. The FTLE value measures the rate of separation of pathlines originating from this plane. Different to previous work using FTLE we do not focus on separating extremal lines but on local minima and regions of low FTLE intensities to extract coherent flow. The coherence map and the extracted clusters serve as basis for the flow exploration. The extracted clusters can be selected and inspected individually. Their flow rate and coherence provide a measure for their significance. Switching off clusters reduces the amount of occlusion and reveals the remaining part of the flow. The non-coherent regions can also be explored by interactive manual pathline seeding in the coherence map."

    "abstract": "We present a novel abstract visualization for the binding sites of proteins. Binding sites play an essential role in enzymatic reactions and are, thus, often investigated in structural biology. They are typically located within cavities. The shape and properties of the cavity influence whether and how easily a substrate can reach the active site where the reaction is triggered. Molecular surface visualizations can help to analyze the accessibility of binding sites, but are typically prone to visual clutter. Our novel abstract visualization shows the cavity containing the binding site as well as the surface region directly surrounding the cavity entrance in a simplified manner. The resulting visualization resembles a hat, where the brim depicts the surrounding surface region and the crown the cavity. Hence, we dubbed our abstraction Molecular Sombrero, using the Spanish term for 'hat'. Our abstraction is less cluttered than traditional molecular surface visualizations. It highlights important parameters, like cavity diameter, by mapping them to the shape of the sombrero. The visual abstraction also facilitates an easy side-by-side comparison of different data sets. We show the applicability of our Molecular Sombreros to different real-world use cases."

In particular, this work implements and evaluates an Automated Anatomical ROI (AA-ROI) approach based on the combination of automatic image registration (AIR) and Distance- Based Transfer Functions (DBTFs), designed for automatic selection of complex anatomical shapes without relying on prohibitive amounts of interaction. Domain knowledge and clinical experience has been included in the project through participation of practicing radiologists in all phases of the project. This has resulted in a set of requirements that are critical for Direct Volume Rendering applications to be utilized in clinical practice and a prototype AA-ROI implementation that was developed to addresses critical points in existing solutions. The feasibility of the developed approach was assessed through a study where five radiologists investigated three medical data sets with complex ROIs, using both traditional tools and the developed prototype software. Our analysis indicate that advanced, registration based ROI schemes could increase clinical efficiency in time-critical settings for cases with complex ROIs, but also that their clinical feasibility is conditional with respect to the radiologists trust in the registration process and its application to the data."

    "abstract": "Assessing surfaces of segmentations extracted from 3D image data for medical purposes requires dedicated extraction and visualization methods. In particular, when assessing follow-up cases, the exact volume and confidence level of the segmentation surface is crucial for medical decision-making. This paper introduces a new processing chain comprising a series of carefully selected and well-matched steps to determine and visualize a segmentation boundary. In a first step, the surface, segmentation confidence and statistical partial volume are extracted. Then, a mesh-based method is applied to determine a refined boundary of the segmented object based on these properties, whilst smoothness, confidence of the surface and partial volume are considered locally. In contrast to existing methods, the proposed approach is able to guarantee the estimated volume for the whole segmentation, which is an important prerequisite for clinical application. Furthermore, a novel visualization method is presented which was specifically designed to simultaneously provide information about 3D morphology, confidence and possible errors. As opposed to classical visualization approaches that take advantage of color and transparency but need some geometric mapping and interpretation from the observer, the proposed scattered visualization utilizes density and scattering, which are much closer and more intuitively related to the original geometric meaning. The presented method is particularly suitable to assess pleural thickenings from follow-up CT images, which further illustrates the potential of the proposed method."

    "abstract": "Image-guided thermal ablation procedures such as microwave ablation (MWA) or radiofrequency ablation (RFA) have become clinically accepted treatment options for liver tumors. The goal of these minimally invasive procedures is the destruction of focal liver malignancies using mostly needle-shaped instruments. Computed tomography (CT) imaging may be used to navigate the applicator to the target position in order to achieve complete tumor ablation. Due to limited image quality and resolution, the treatment target and risk structures may be hardly visible in intra-interventional CT-images, hampering verification of the intended applicator position. In this work, we propose a navigation guidance method based only on CT images to support the physician with additional information to reach the target position. Therefore, planning information extracted from pre-interventional images is fused with the current intra-interventional image. The visible applicator is extracted semi-automatically from the intra-interventional image. The localization of the needle instrument is used to guide the physician by display of the pathway, projection of anatomical structures, and correction suggestions. In an evaluation, we demonstrate the potential of the proposed method to improve the clinical success rate of complex liver tumor ablations while increasing the accuracy and reducing the number of intra-interventional CT images needed."

The approach exploits a geometrical property of the majority of the organisms - star-shapedness - and is based on contour averaging in polar space. It is robust and computationally efficient, where robustness is due to the absence of tuneable parameters. Moreover, the algorithm preserves the uncertainty (in terms of the standard deviation) of the experts' opinion, which allows to introduce an uncertainty-aware metric for estimation of the segmentation quality. This metric emphasizes the influence of ground truth regions with low variance. We study the performance of the proposed averaging method on time-lapse microscopy data of Corynebacterium glutamicum and the uncertainty-aware metric on synthetic data."

    "abstract": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) enables volumetric and time-varying measurements of blood-flow data. Such data have shown potential to improve diagnosis and risk assessment of various cardiovascular diseases. Hereby, a unique way of analysing patient-specific haemodynamics becomes possible. However, these measurements are susceptible to artifacts, noise and a coarse spatio-temporal resolution. Furthermore, typical flow visualization techniques rely on interpolation. For example, using pathlines requires a high quality temporal resolution. While numerical simulations, based on mathematical flow models, address some of these limitations, the involved modelling assumptions (e.g., regarding the inflow and mesh) do not provide patientspecific data to the degree actual measurements would. To overcome this issue, data assimilation techniques can be applied to use measured data in order to steer a physically-based simulation of the flow, combining the benefits of measured data and simulation. Our work builds upon such an existing solution to increase the temporal resolution of the measured data, but achieves significantly higher fidelity. We avoid the previous damping and interpolation bias towards one of the measurements, by simulating bidrectionally (forwards and backwards through time) and using sources and sinks. Our method is evaluated and compared to the, currently-used, conventional interpolation scheme and forward-only simulation using measured and analytical flow data. It reduces artifacts, noise, and interpolation error, while being closer to laminar flow, as is expected for flow in vessels."

It allows physicians to inspect the dynamics of a beating heart, such as myocardium motion and blood flows. Because the material intensity changes over time in a typical CMR scan, this poses a challenging problem in specifying an effective transfer function for depicting the geometry of a beating heart or other moving objects. In this paper, we propose to moderate the traditional transfer function based on intensity and intensity gradient. This enables us to depict the exterior boundary of a beating heart in a temporally consistent manner. We examine several different ways of moderating an intensity-based transfer function, and evaluate these designs in conjunction with practical CMR data. We present a ray-casting pipeline which includes optional flow estimation and a mechanism to assist temporal coherence in animation."

Moreover, this framework is used to find optimal smoothing parameters automatically and to provide data-specific parameter suggestions."

    "abstract": "In medical visualization of surface information, problems often arise when visualizing several overlapping structures simultaneously. There is a trade-off between visualizing multiple structures in a detailed way and limiting visual clutter, in order to allow users to focus on the main structures. Illustrative visualization techniques can help alleviate these problems by defining a level of abstraction per structure. However, clinical uptake of these advanced visualization techniques so far has been limited due to the complex parameter settings required. To bring advanced medical visualization closer to clinical application, we propose a novel illustrative technique that offers a seamless transition between various levels of abstraction and detail. Using a single comprehensive parameter, users are able to quickly define a visual representation per structure that fits the visualization requirements for focus and context structures. This technique can be applied to any biomedical context in which multiple surfaces are routinely visualized, such as neurosurgery, radiotherapy planning or drug design. Additionally, we introduce a novel hatching technique, that runs in real-time and does not require texture coordinates. An informal evaluation with experts from different biomedical domains reveals that our technique allows users to design focus-and-context visualizations in a fast and intuitive manner."

    "abstract": "Preoperative neck dissection planning benefits from a smooth, organic visualization of the main blood vessels of the neck, in particular the carotid artery and jugular vein. While most reconstruction techniques for vasculature are designed for segmenting the complete vessel tree, our goal is to isolate these specific blood vessels of the neck from the CT dataset, and to exclude irrelevant vasculature from the visualization. Pure threshold- and iso value-based reconstruction techniques do not allow such a selective segmentation and often lead to undersegmentation at the lower parts of the blood vessels, due to inhomogeneous contrast agent diffusion. In order to avoid staircase artifacts in the visualizations of the reconstructed vascular structures, a subvoxel accuracy of the reconstruction technique is also required. We present a model-based reconstruction technique to isolate blood vessels from neck CT datasets using Stable 3D Mass-Spring Models. The results can be visualized directly without staircase artifacts. The interaction needed for the reconstruction is reduced substantially to only a few clicks along the blood vessels. The presented method was evaluated with 30 blood vessels from 14 CT datasets of the neck and could be shown to be accurate, while leading to smooth visualizations of the neck blood vessels."

    "abstract": "In this paper we present a robust skull-stripping method for the isolation of cerebral tissue in 3D Time-of-Flight (TOF) magnetic resonance angiographic images of the brain. 3D TOF images are often acquired in case of cerebral vascular diseases, because of their good blood-to-background-contrast. Skull-stripping is an essential preprocessing step towards a better segmentation as well as direct visualization of the vascular system. Our approach consists of three main steps. After preprocessing in order to reduce signal inhomogeneities and noise the first main step is the segmentation of the surrounding skull using a region growing approach. The second step is the automatic extraction of distinctive points at the border of the brain, based on the segmentation of the skull, which are then used as supporting points for a graph based contour extraction. The third step is a slicewise correction based on a non-linear registration in order to improve sub-optimal segmentation results. The method proposed was validated using 18 manually stripped datasets. The calculated similarity measures show that the proposed method leads to good segmentation results with only a few segmentation errors. At the same time the mean rate of vessel voxels included by the brain segmentation is 99.18%. In summary the procedure suggested allows a fast and fully automatic segmentation of the brain and is especially helpful as a preprocessing step towards an automatic segmentation of the vessel system or direct volume rendering."

    "abstract": "Ultrasonography allows informative and expressive real time examinations of patients. Findings are usually reported as printouts, screen shots and video sequences. However, in certain scenarios, the amount of imaged ultrasound data is considerable or it is challenging to detect the anatomical features of interest. Post-examination access to the information present in the data is, therefore, cumbersome. The examiner must, in fact, review entire video sequences or risk to lose relevant information by reducing the examination to single screen shot and printouts. In this paper we propose a novel post-processing pipeline for guided visual exploration of ultrasound video sequences, to allow easier and richer exploration and analysis of the data. We demonstrate the usefulness of this approach by applying it to a liver examination case, showing easier and quicker ultrasound image selection and data exploration."

In this work, we provide new information of cerebral artery walls extracted with optical coherence tomography (OCT) ex vivo. We present first results of cerebral vessel wall characteristics combined with histological image data. As a prerequisite for this combination, a new image processing method called virtual inflation was developed. This method accounts for the missing blood pressure causing collapsing of the vessels as well as geometrical shape deformations due to catheter probing and histological imaging. We sample the vessel wall thickness locally based on the (deflated) vessel-lumen border instead of the vessel's centerline. The virtual inflation allows for co-aligning of the different image modalities. It is embedded in a multiple coordinated view framework where correspondences between the data can be highlighted via brushing and linking. In combination with histologic image data, we provide OCT signal characteristics of the human cerebral artery wall."

    "abstract": "The colon is an organ whose constant motility poses difficulties to its analysis. Although morphological data can be successfully extracted from Computational Tomography, its radiative nature makes it only indicated for patients with disorders. Only recently, acquisition techniques that rely on the use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging have matured enough to enable the generation of morphological colon data of healthy patients without preparation (i. e. administration of drugs or contrast agents). As a result, a database of colon morphological data for patients under different diets, has been created. Currently, the digestologists we collaborate with analyze the measured data of the gut by inspecting a set of spreadsheets. In this paper, we propose a system for the exploratory visual analysis of the whole database of morphological data at once. It provides features for the visual comparison of data correlations, the inspection of the morphological measures, as well 3D rendering of the colon segmented models. The system solely relies on the use of web technologies, which makes it portable even to mobile devices."

This allows the user to easily detect foci in the PET data and to localize these regions by providing anatomical contextual information from the CT data. Furthermore, we provide transfer function specifically designed for PET data that facilitates the investigation of interesting regions. Our technique allows users to get a quick overview of regions of interest and can be used in treatment planning, doctor-patient communication and interdisciplinary communication.

Still, to our knowledge all these methods are based on a single choice of the underlying segmentation approach. Segmentation using an ensemble of classifiers (or committee machine) use multiple classifiers to increase the performance when compared to applying a single classifier. In this paper, we propose methods to estimate uncertainties in segmentations produced by ensembles of classifiers. We investigate and compare the different combining strategies of the segmentation results of the ensemble members from an uncertainty point of view. We discuss why some combining strategies tend to perform better than others. Also, we visualize the estimated uncertainties using a color mapping in image space and propose a post-segmentations correction step to reclassify the noisy pixels in the final result based on the statistical uncertainty."

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have enabled dramatic improvements in the accuracy of automated medical image segmentation. Despite this, in many cases, results are still not reliable enough to be trusted ''blindly''. Consequently, a human rater is responsible to check correctness of the final result and needs to be able to correct any segmentation errors that he or she might notice. For a particular use case, segmentation of the retinal pigment epithelium and Bruch's membrane from Optical Coherence Tomography, we develop a system that makes this process more efficient by guiding the rater to segmentations that are most likely to require attention from a human expert, and by developing semi-automated tools for segmentation correction that exploit intermediate representations from the CNN.We demonstrate that our automated ranking of segmentation uncertainty correlates well with a manual assessment of segmentation quality, and with distance to a ground truth segmentation. We also show that, when used together, uncertainty guidance and our semi-automated editing tools decrease the time required for segmentation correction by more than a factor of three."

Our tool is unique and has been specifically designed to match the ambitions of our domain experts to model and interactively visualize structures comprised of several billions atom. The cellVIEW system integrates acceleration techniques to allow for real-time graphics performance of 60 Hz display rate on datasets representing large viruses and bacterial organisms. Inspired by the work of scientific illustrators, we propose a level-of-detail scheme which purpose is two-fold: accelerating the rendering and reducing visual clutter. The main part of our datasets is made out of macromolecules, but it also comprises nucleic acids strands which are stored as sets of control points. For that specific case, we extend our rendering method to support the dynamic generation of DNA strands directly on the GPU. It is noteworthy that our tool has been directly implemented inside a game engine. We chose to rely on a third party engine to reduce software development work-load and to make bleeding-edge graphics techniques more accessible to the end-users. To our knowledge cellVIEW is the only suitable solution for interactive visualization of large bimolecular landscapes on the atomic level and is freely available to use and extend."

    "abstract": "The community structure of networks plays an important role in their analysis. It represents a high-level organization of objects within a network. However, in many application domains, the relationship between objects in a network changes over time, resulting in the change of community structure (the partition of a network), their attributes (the composition of a community and the values of relationships between communities), or both. Previous animation or timeline-based representations either visualize the change of attributes of networks or the community structure. There is no single method that can optimally show graphs that change in both structure and attributes. In this paper we propose a method for the case of dynamic EEG coherence networks to assist users in exploring the dynamic changes in both their community structure and their attributes. The method uses an initial timeline representation which was designed to provide an overview of changes in community structure. In addition, we order communities and assign colors to them based on their relationships by adapting the existing Temporal Multidimensional Scaling (TMDS) method. Users can identify evolution patterns of dynamic networks from this visualization."

Its analysis is an essential task for medical researchers to understand diseases and find proper treatments. In this context, visualization approaches became an important tool to locate, quantify, and analyze brain lesions. Unfortunately, image uncertainty highly effects the accuracy of the visualization output. These effects are not covered well in existing approaches, leading to miss-interpretation or a lack of trust in the analysis result. In this work, we present an uncertainty-aware visualization pipeline especially designed for brain lesions. Our method is based on an uncertainty measure for image data that forms the input of an uncertainty-aware segmentation approach. Here, medical doctors can determine the lesion in the patient's brain and the result can be visualized by an uncertainty-aware geometry rendering. We applied our approach to two patient datasets to review the lesions. Our results indicate increased knowledge discovery in brain lesion analysis that provides a quantification of trust in the generated results."

    "abstract": "Kinetic modeling is the tool of choice when developing new positron emission tomography (PET) tracers for quantitative functional analysis. Several approaches are widely used to facilitate this process. While all these approaches are inherently different, they are still subject to uncertainty arising from various stages of the modeling process. In this paper we propose a novel approach for deriving and visualizing uncertainty in kinetic PET modeling. We distinguish between intra- and inter-model uncertainties. While intra-model uncertainty allows us to derive uncertainty based on a single modeling approach, inter-model uncertainty arises from the differences of the results of different approaches. To derive intra-model uncertainty we exploit the covariance matrix analysis. The inter-model uncertainty is derived by comparing the outcome of three standard kinetic PET modeling approaches. We derive and visualize this uncertainty to exploit it as a basis for changing model input parameters with the ultimate goal to reduce the modeling uncertainty and thus obtain a more realistic model of the tracer under investigation. To support this uncertainty reduction process, we visually link abstract and spatial data by introducing a novel visualization approach based on the ThemeRiver metaphor, which has been modified to support the uncertainty-aware visualization of parameter changes between spatial locations. We have investigated the benefits of the presented concepts by conducting an evaluation with domain experts."

Standard solutions show all the information in linear lists, often leading to cognitive overload; research solutions provide timelines and relations between the notes but provide too much fragmented information. We propose MEDeNAR, a system for enabling medical professionals to obtain insights from EHRs based on the different tasks in their workflow. The key aspects of our system are the introduction of an intermediate level that summarizes the information using clustering and NLP methods. The results are visualized along a timeline and provide easy access to the detailed descriptions in notes and lab results at the EHR level. We designed the system using an iterative design process in collaboration with 18 doctors, two nurses and 14 domain experts. During the final evaluation, the doctors ranked our system higher than a standard baseline solution and a variation for the used NLP methods."

    "abstract": "Retinal microsurgery is one of the most challenging types of surgery, yet in practice, intraoperative digital assistance is rare. The introduction of fast, microscope integrated Optical Coherence Tomography (iOCT) has enabled intraoperative imaging of subsurface structures. However, effective intraoperative visualization of this data poses a challenging problem both in terms of performance and engineering as well as for creating easily interpretable visualizations of this data. Most existing research focuses on visualization of diagnostic OCT data where imaging quality is higher and processing times are not an issue. We introduce a perceptually linear color map for a separated encoding of tissue reflectivity and positional information as chrominance and luminance. Based on this color mapping, we propose a Direct Volume Rendering (DVR) method that aids structure perception. To aid subretinal injection tasks, we introduce a novel Layer-Adjusted Maximum Intensity Projection (LA-MIP), correcting for the natural curvature of the retinal tissue. Expert feedback suggests our methods are preferred over baseline methods. Further research is needed to confirm the benefits of our approach in routine clinical applications."

    "abstract": "In this paper we introduce a novel augmented-reality (AR) system for the sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy. The AR system consists of a cubic recording device with integrated stereo near-infrared (NIR) and stereo color cameras, an head mounted display (HMD) for visualizing the SLN information directly into the physicians view and a controlling software application. The labeling of the SLN is achieved using the fluorescent dye indocyanine green (ICG). The dye accumulates in the SLN where it is excited to fluorescence by applying infrared light. The fluorescence is recorded from two directions by the NIR stereo cameras using appropriate filters. Applying the known rigid camera geometry, an ICG depth map can be generated from the camera images, thus creating a live 3D representation of the SLN. The representation is then superimposed to the physicians field of view, by applying a series of coordinate system transformations, that are determined in four separate system calibration steps. To compensate for the head motion, the recording systems is continuously tracked by a single camera on the HMD using fiducial markers. Because the system does not require additional monitors, the physicians attention is kept solely on the operation site. This can potentially decrease the intervention time and render the procedure safer for the patient."

    "abstract": "Time-dependent volumetric data has important applications in areas as diverse as medicine, climatology, and engineering. However, the simultaneous quantitative assessment of spatial and temporal features is very challenging. Common visualization techniques show either the whole volume in one time step (for example using direct volume rendering) or let the user select a region of interest (ROI) for which a collection of time-intensity curves is shown. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that dynamically embeds quantitative detail views in a spatial layout. Inspired by the concept of small multiples, we introduce a new primitive graxel (graph pixel). Graxels are view dependent primitives of time-intensity graphs, generated on-the-fly by aggregating per-ray information over time and image regions. Our method enables the detailed feature-aligned visual analysis of time-dependent volume data and allows interactive refinement and filtering. Temporal behaviors like frequency relations, aperiodic or periodic oscillations and their spatial context are easily perceived with our method. We demonstrate the power of our approach using examples from medicine and the natural sciences."

    "abstract": "The presence of depth cues in a visualization can be a great aid in understanding the structure and topology of a vessel tree. Pseudo Chromadepth is a well-known technique for enhancing depth perception in vascular 3D models. Since it strongly relies on the color channel to convey its depth cues, it is traditionally not suited for combined visualizations comprising color-encoded surface parameters. In this paper, we present and evaluate the use of a modified form of Pseudo Chromadepth that supports displaying additional surface parameters using the color channel while still increasing depth perception. This technique has been designed for the visualization of cerebral aneurysm models. We have combined a discretized color scale to visualize the surface parameter with the Pseudo Chromadepth color scale to convey depth using a Fresnel-inspired blending mask. To evaluate our approach, we have conducted two consecutive studies. The first was performed with 104 participants from the general public and the second with eleven experts in the fields of medical engineering and flow simulation. These studies show that Pseudo Chromadepth can be used in conjunction with color-encoded surface attributes to support depth perception as long as the color scale is chosen appropriately."

    "abstract": "Aortic dissection is a life threatening condition of the aorta, characterized by separation of its wall layers into a true and false lumen. A subset of patients require immediate surgical or endovascular repair. All survivors of the acute phase need long-term surveillance with imaging to monitor chronic degeneration and dilatation of the false lumen and prevent late adverse events such as rupture, or malperfusion. We introduce four novel plots displaying features of aortic dissections known or presumed to be associated with risk of future adverse events: Aortic diameter, the blood supply (outflow) to the aortic branches from the true and false lumen, the previous treatment, and an estimate of adverse event-free probabilities in one, two and 5 years. Aortic dissection maps, the composite visualization of these plots, provide a baseline for visual comparison of the complex features and associated risk of aortic dissection. These maps may lead to more individualized monitoring and improved, patient-centric treatment planning in the future."

    "abstract": "Cavities are crucial for interactions of proteins with other molecules. While a variety of different cavity types exists, tunnels in particular play an important role, as they enable a ligand to deeply enter the active site of a protein where chemical reactions can undergo. Consequently, domain scientists are interested in understanding properties relevant for binding interactions inside molecular tunnels. Unfortunately, when inspecting a 3D representation of the molecule under investigation, tunnels are difficult to analyze due to occlusion issues. Therefore, within this paper we propose a novel reprojection technique that transforms the 3D structure of a molecule to obtain a 2D representation of the tunnel interior. The reprojection has been designed with respect to application-oriented design guidelines, we have identified together with our domain partners. To comply with these guidelines, the transformation preserves individual residues, while the result is capable of showing binding properties inside the tunnel without suffering from occlusions. Thus the reprojected tunnel interior can be used to display physico-chemical properties, e.g., hydrophobicity or amino acid orientation, of residues near a tunnel's surface. As these properties are essential for the interaction between protein and ligand, they can thus hint angles of attack for protein engineers. To demonstrate the benefits of the developed visualization, the obtained results are discussed with respect to domain expert feedback."

    "abstract": "Visualization of contrast enhanced blood vessels in CT angiography data presents a challenge due to varying concentration of the contrast agent. The purpose of this work is to evaluate the correctness (effectiveness) in visualizing the vessel lumen using two different 3D visualization strategies, thereby assessing the feasibility of using such visualizations for diagnostic decisions. We compare a standard visualization approach with a recent method which locally adapts to the contrast agent concentration. Both methods are evaluated in a parallel setting where the participant is instructed to produce a complete visualization of the vessel lumen, including both large and small vessels, in cases of calcified vessels in the legs. The resulting visualizations are thereafter compared in a slice viewer to assess the correctness of the visualized lumen. The results indicate that the participants generally overestimated the size of the vessel lumen using the standard visualization, whereas the locally adaptive method better conveyed the true anatomy. The participants did find the interpretation of the locally adaptive method to be less intuitive, but also noted that this did not introduce any prohibitive complexity in the work flow. The observed trends indicate that the visualized lumen strongly depends on the width and placement of the applied transfer function and that this dependency is inherently local rather than global. We conclude that methods that permit local adjustments, such as the method investigated in this study, can be beneficial to certain types of visualizations of large vascular trees."

    "abstract": "In real-time volume data acquisition, such as 4D ultrasound, the raw data is challenging to visualize directly without additional processing. Noise removal and feature detection are common operations, but many methods are too costly to compute over the whole volume when dealing with live streamed data. In this paper, we propose a visibility-driven processing scheme for handling costly on-the-fly processing of volumetric data in real-time. In contrast to the traditional visualization pipeline, our scheme utilizes a fast computation of the potentially visible subset of voxels which significantly reduces the amount of data required to process. As filtering operations modify the data values which may affect their visibility, our method for visibility-mask generation ensures that the set of elements deemed visible does not change after processing. Our approach also exploits the visibility information for the storage of intermediate values when multiple operations are performed in sequence, and can therefore significantly reduce the memory overhead of longer filter pipelines. We provide a thorough technical evaluation of the approach and demonstrate it on several typical scenarios where on-the-fly processing is required."

    "abstract": "the intra-voxel diffusion pattern compared to its simpler predecessor diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). However, HARDI in general produces very noisy diffusion patterns due to the low SNR from the scanners at high b-values. Furthermore, it still exhibits limitations in areas where the diffusion pattern is asymmetrical (bifurcations, splaying fibers, etc.). To overcome these limitations, enhancement and denoising of the data based on context information is a crucial step. In order to achieve it, convolutions are performed in the coupled spatial and angular domain. Therefore the kernels applied become also HARDI data. However, these approaches have high computational complexity of an already complex HARDI data processing. In this work, we present an accelerated framework for HARDI data regularizaton and enhancement. The convolution operators are optimized by: pre-calculating the kernels, analysing kernels shape and utilizing look-up-tables. We provide an increase of speed, compared to previous brute force approaches of simpler kernels. These methods can be used as a preprocessing for tractography and lead to new ways for investigation of brain white matter."

    "abstract": "Abstract Mammography is the common modality used for screening and early detection of breast cancer. The emergence of machine learning, particularly deep learning methods, aims to assist radiologists to reach higher sensitivity and specificity. Yet, typical supervised machine learning methods demand the radiological images to have findings annotated within the image. This is a tedious task, which is often out of reach due to the high cost and unavailability of expert radiologists. We describe a computeraided detection and diagnosis system for weakly supervised learning, where the mammogram (MG) images are tagged only on a global level, without local annotations. Our work addresses the problem of MG classification and detection of abnormal findings through a novel deep learning framework built on the multiple instance learning (MIL) paradigm. Our proposed method processes the MG image utilizing the full resolution, with a deep MIL convolutional neural network. This approach allows us to classify the whole MG according to a severity score and localize the source of abnormality in full resolution, while trained on a weakly labeled data set. The key hallmark of our approach is automatic discovery of the discriminating patches in the mammograms using MIL. We validate the proposed method on two mammogram data sets, a large multi-center MG cohort and the publicly available INbreast, in two different scenarios. We present promising results in classification and detection, comparable to a recent supervised method that was trained on fully annotated data set. As the volume and complexity of data in healthcare continues to increase, such an approach may have a profound impact on patient care in many applications."

    "abstract": "Multi-modal imaging allows for the integration of complementary information from multiple medical imaging modalities for an improved analysis. The multiple information channels may lead to a reduction of the uncertainty in the analysis and decision-making process. Recently, efforts have been made to estimate the uncertainty in unimodal image segmentation decisions and visually convey this information to the medical experts that examine the image segmentation results. We propose an approach to extend uncertainty estimation and visualization methods to multi-modal image segmentations. We combine probabilistic uni-modal image segmentation results using the concept of ensemble of classifiers. The uncertainty is computed using a measure that is based on the Kullback- Leibler divergence. We apply our approach for an improved segmentation of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) lesions from multiple MR brain imaging modalities. Moreover, we demonstrate how our approach can be used to estimate and visualize the growth of a brain tumor area for imaging data taken at multiple points in time. Both the MS lesion and the area of tumor growth are detected as areas of high uncertainty due to different characteristics in different imaging modalities and changes over time, respectively."

    "abstract": "Machine learning is becoming increasingly popular in the medical domain. In the near future, clinicians expect predictive models to support daily tasks such as diagnosis and prognostic analysis. For this reason, it is utterly important to evaluate and compare the performance of such models so that clinicians can safely rely on them. In this paper, we focus on sleep staging wherein machine learning models can be used to automate or support sleep scoring. Evaluation of these models is complex because sleep is a natural process, which varies among patients. For adoption in clinical routine, it is important to understand how the models perform for different groups of patients. Moreover, models can be trained to recognize different characteristics in the data, and model developers need to understand why and how performance of the different models varies. To address these challenges, we present a visual analytics approach to evaluate the performance of predictive models on sleep staging and to help experts better understand these models with respect to patient data (e.g., conditions, medication, etc.). We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing multiple models trained on real-world sleep staging data with experts."

The prototypical software solution presented in this paper addresses the issue that a high amount of interaction is commonly needed to merge different MRI sequences and that the resulting visualization does not allow to recognize anatomical details of the brain and pathological tissue at the same time without loss of information. We also present novel clipping methods for neurological volume exploration and emphasize important structures as well as suspicious high intensity signals from multiple sequences in the volume rendering. We demonstrate that our methods facilitate comprehensive volume visualization for neurosurgery."

    "abstract": "Brain MR images are one of the most important instruments for diagnosing neurological disorders such as tumors, infections or trauma. In particular, grade I-IV brain tumors are a well-studied subject for supervised deep learning approaches. However, for a clinical use of these approaches, a very large annotated database that covers all of the occurring variance is necessary. As MR scanners are not quantitative, it is unclear how good supervised approaches, trained on a specific database, will actually perform on a new set of images that may stem from a yet other scanner. We propose a new method for brain tumor segmentation, that can not only identify abnormal regions, but can also delineate brain tumors into three characteristic radiological areas: The edema, the enhancing core, and the non-enhancing and necrotic tissue. Our concept is based on FLAIR and T1CE MRI sequences, where abnormalities are detected with a variational autoencoder trained on healthy examples. The detected areas are finally postprocessed via Gaussian Mixture Models and finally classified according to the three defined labels. We show results on the BraTS2018 dataset and compare these to previously published unsupervised segmentation results as well as to the results of the BraTS challenge 2018. Our developed unsupervised anomaly detection approach is on par with previously published methods. Meanwhile, the semantic segmentation - a new and unique model - shows encouraging results."

These fibrils play a crucial role in the development of Alzheimer's disease, and yet its creation and structure are not fully understood. Visualization is often used to understand the structure of such fibrils. Unfortunately, existing algorithms require high memory consumption limiting their applications. In this paper, we introduce a ray marching algorithm that takes advantage of the inherent repetition in these atomic structures, requiring only a 2D density map to represent the fibril. During ray marching, the texture coordinates are transformed based on the position of the sample along the longitudinal axis, simulating the rotation of the fibrils. Our algorithm reduces memory consumption by a large margin and improves GPU cache hits, making it suitable for real-time visualizations. Moreover, we present several shading algorithms for this type of data, such as shadows or ambient occlusion, in order to improve perception. Lastly, we provide a simple yet effective algorithm to communicate the uncertainty introduced during reconstruction. During the evaluation process, we were able to show, that our approach not only outperforms the Standard Volume Rendering method by significantly lower memory consumption and high image quality for low resolution 2D density maps but also in performance."

For complex cases, where Stage 2 does not lead to a decisive strategy, Stage 3 reinforces analysis of interdependencies of scalar fields via bivariate visualization. Our system is designed to be immediate applicable in medical practice. We analyze the design space of potentially useful visualization techniques and appraise their effectiveness in the context of our design goals. Furthermore, we present a user study, which reveals the disadvantages of manual analysis in the measurement stage of evaluation and highlight the demand for computer-support through our system."

    "abstract": "Four-dimensional phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (4D PC-MRI) allows for the non-invasive acquisition of in-vivo blood flow, producing a patient-specific blood flow model in selected vascular structures, e.g. the aorta. In the past, many specialized techniques for the visualization and exploration of such datasets have been developed, yet a tool for the visual comparison of multiple datasets is missing. Due to the complexity of the underlying data, a simple side-by-side comparison of two datasets using traditional visualization techniques can only yield coarse results. In this paper, we present a toolkit that allows for an efficient and robust registration of different 4D PC-MRI datasets and offers a variety of both qualitative and quantitative comparison techniques. Differences in the segmentation and time frame can be amended semi-automatically using landmarks on the vessel centerline and flow curve of the datasets. A set of measures quantifying the difference between the datasets, such as the flow jet displacement or flow angle and velocity difference, is automatically computed. To support the orientation in the spatio-temporal domain of the flow dataset, we provide bulls-eye plots that highlight potentially interesting regions. In an evaluation with three experienced radiologists, we confirmed the usefulness of our technique. With our application, they were able to discover previously unnoticed artifacts occurring in a dataset acquired with an experimental MRI sequence."

To this end, we introduce a capture system that reconstructs the 3D motion of the skin from multi-view video data and simultaneously measures true muscle activity with EMG sensors. Our data reveals strong correlations between the skin deformation and muscular activity during one-leg stances. We propose a pose normalization procedure and a novel model based on Supervised Principal Component Regression that automatically segments individual muscles and estimates their activation from 3D surface deformation. Our evaluation shows that the model generalizes to varying body shapes and that the estimated activation closely fits the measured EMG data."

However, resulting visualizations often suffer from visual clutter which makes exploration challenging. This paper presents the BundleExplorer as a GPU-based focus and context rendering framework for diffusion data. A combination of a fiber encompassing hull and line rendering is proposed to provide insight into inner-bundle fiber configurations as well as to enable bundle crossing exploration. Visual clutter is reduced and information about the global bundle geometry is provided by using fiber encompassing hulls. At the same time important characteristics, such as individual trajectory courses, which are conventionally neglected when using hull visualizations, are revealed by cutaway techniques and enhanced line renderings. In addition, spatial features, the distance to the fiber hull, as well as functional features, i.e., the degree of anisotropy, are visualized using fiber color encoding. Different cutaway techniques using marker and view-dependent clippings are implemented in order to reveal focus information. Visual enhancements are used to indicate bundle intersections."
