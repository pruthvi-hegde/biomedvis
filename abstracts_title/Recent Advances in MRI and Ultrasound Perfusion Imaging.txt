Recent Advances in MRI and Ultrasound Perfusion Imaging. Perfusion imaging is an important diagnostic tool used mostly in oncology, neurology and cardiology, to assess the perfusion status of the tissue on a capillary level, e.g. assessment of angiogenesis, ischemic regions and inflammation. This contribution is a review of recent advances in dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic-resonance and ultrasound imaging.
