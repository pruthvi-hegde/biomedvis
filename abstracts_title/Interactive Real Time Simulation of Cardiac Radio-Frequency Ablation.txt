Interactive Real Time Simulation of Cardiac Radio-Frequency Ablation. Virtual reality based therapy simulation meets a growing interest from the medical community due to its potential impact for the training of medical residents and the planning of therapies. In this paper, we describe a prototype for rehearsing radio-frequency ablation of the myocardium in the context of cardiac arrhythmia. Our main focus has been on the real-time modeling of electrophysiology which is suitable for representing simple cases of arrhythmia (ectopic focus, ventricular tachycardia). To this end, we use an anisotropic multi-front fast marching method to simulate transmembrane potential propagation in cardiac tissues. The electric propagation is coupled with a pre-recorded beating heart model. Thanks to a 3D user interface, the user can interactively measure the local extracellular potential, pace locally the myocardium or simulate the burning of cardiac tissue as done in radiofrequency ablation interventions. To illustrate this work, we show the simulation of various arrhythmias cases built from patient specific medical images including the right and left ventricles, the fiber orientation and the location of ischemic regions.
