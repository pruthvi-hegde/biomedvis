Interactive CPU-based Ray Tracing of Solvent Excluded Surfaces. Depictions of molecular surfaces such as the Solvent Excluded Surface (SES) can provide crucial insight into functional molecular properties, such as the molecule's potential to react. The interactive visualization of single and multiple molecule surfaces is essential for the data analysis by domain experts. Nowadays, the SES can be rendered at high frame rates using shader-based ray casting on the GPU. However, rendering large molecules or larger molecule complexes requires large amounts of memory that has the potential to exceed the memory limitations of current hardware. Here we show that rendering using CPU ray tracing also reaches interactive frame rates without hard limitations to memory. In our results large molecule complexes can be rendered with only the precomputation of each individual SES, and no further involved representation or transformation. Additionally, we provide advanced visualization techniques like ambient occlusion opacity mapping (AOOM) to enhance the comprehensibility of the molecular structure. CPU ray tracing not only provides very high image quality and global illumination, which is beneficial for the perception of spatial structures, it also opens up the possibility to visualize larger data sets and to render on any HPC cluster. Our results demonstrate that simple instancing of geometry keeps the memory consumption for rendering large molecule complexes low, so the examination of much larger data is also possible.
