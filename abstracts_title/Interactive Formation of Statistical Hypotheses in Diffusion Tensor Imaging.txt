Interactive Formation of Statistical Hypotheses in Diffusion Tensor Imaging. When Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is used in clinical studies, statistical hypothesis testing is the standard approach to establish significant differences between groups, such as patients and healthy controls. However, diffusion tensors contain six degrees of freedom, and the most commonly used univariate tests reduce them to a single scalar, such as Fractional Anisotropy. Multivariate tests that account for the full tensor information have been developed, but have not been widely adopted in practice. Based on analyzing the limitations of existing univariate and multivariate tests, we argue that it is beneficial to use a more flexible, steerable test. Therefore, we introduce a test that can be customized to include any subset of tensor attributes that are relevant to the analysis task at hand. We also present a visual analytics system that supports the exploratory task of customizing it to a specific scenario. Our system closely integrates quantitative analysis with suitable visualizations. It links spatial and abstract views to reveal clusters of strong differences, to relate them to the affected anatomical structures, and to visually compare the results of different tests. A use case is presented in which our system leads to the formation of several new hypotheses about the effects of systemic lupus erythematosus on water diffusion in the brain.
