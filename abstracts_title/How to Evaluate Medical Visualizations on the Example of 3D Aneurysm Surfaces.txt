How to Evaluate Medical Visualizations on the Example of 3D Aneurysm Surfaces. For the evaluation of medical visualizations, a ground truth is often missing. Therefore, the evaluation of medical visualizations is often restricted to qualitative comparisons w.r.t user preferences but neglects more objective measures such as accuracies or task completion times. In this work, we provide a pipeline with statistical tests for the evaluation of the user performance within an experimental setup. We demonstrate the adaption of the pipeline for the specific example of cerebral aneurysm surface visualization. Therefore, we developed three visualization techniques to compare the aneurysm volumes. Then, we present a single-factor, within-subject user study, which allows for the evaluation of these visualization techniques as well as the identification of the most suitable one. The evaluation includes a qualitative as well as a comprehensive quantitative analysis to determine statistically significant differences. As a result, a color-coded map surface view is identified as best suited to depict the aneurysm volume changes. The presentation of the different stages of the evaluation pipeline allows for an easy adaption to other application areas of medical visualization. As a result, we provide orientation to enrich qualitative evaluations by the presented quantitative analyses.
