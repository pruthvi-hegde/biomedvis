AR-Assisted Craniotomy Planning for Tumour Resection. Craniotomy is a procedure where neurosurgeons open the patient's skull to gain direct access to the brain. The craniotomy's position defines the access path from the skull surface to the tumour and, consequently, the healthy brain tissue to be removed to reach the tumour. This is a complex procedure where a neurosurgeon is required to mentally reconstruct spatial relations of important brain structures to avoid removing them as much as possible. We propose a visualisation method using Augmented Reality to assist in the planning of a craniotomy. The goal of this study is to visualise important brain structures aligned with the physical position of the patient and to allow a better perception of the spatial relations of the structures. Additionally, a heat map was developed that is projected on top of the skull to provide a quick overview of the structures between a chosen location on the skull and the tumour. In the experiments, tracking accuracy was assessed, and colour maps were assessed for use in an AR device. Additionally, we conducted a user study amongst neurosurgeons and surgeons from other fields to evaluate the proposed visualisation using a phantom head. Most participants indeed agree that the visualisation can assist in planning a craniotomy and feedback on future improvements towards the clinical scenario was collected.
