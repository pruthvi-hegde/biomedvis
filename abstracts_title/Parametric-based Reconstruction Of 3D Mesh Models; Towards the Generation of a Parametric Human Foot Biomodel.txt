Parametric-based Reconstruction Of 3D Mesh Models; Towards the Generation of a Parametric Human Foot Biomodel. In this work a new reconstruction technique is presented based on Parametric-Based Deformation. The new method uses a template 3D mesh model which is deformed according to user-defined semantic parameters in order to derive a new 3D object. The proposed methodology is divided in three stages: template construction (production of a template mesh model), regression (the template model is deformed to match sample models) and prediction (new instance mesh models are derived based on user parameters). The proposed method has been successfully applied for the reconstruction of human and animal skeletal models. A practical and novel reconstruction methodology has been developed and implemented for the reconstruction of the human foot given a bi-planar X-ray. The purpose of this methodology is to support the parametric generation of human foot biomodels in an automated way. The generated biomodels are employed by simulation tools based on Finite Element Analysis to test the stress factors that the foot is undertaking during its contact with the ground or a footwear sole structure.
