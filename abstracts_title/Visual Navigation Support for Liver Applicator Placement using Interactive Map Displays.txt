Visual Navigation Support for Liver Applicator Placement using Interactive Map Displays. Navigated placement of an ablation applicator in liver surgery would benefit from an effective intraoperative visualization of delicate 3D anatomical structures. In this paper, we propose an approach that facilitates surgery with an interactive as well as an animated map display to support navigated applicator placement in the liver. By reducing the visual complexity of 3D anatomical structures, we provide only the most important information on and around a planned applicator path. By employing different illustrative visualization techniques, the applicator path and its surrounding critical structures, such as blood vessels, are clearly conveyed in an unobstructed way. To retain contextual information around the applicator path and its tip, we desaturate these structures with increasing distance. To alleviate time-consuming and tedious interaction during surgery, our visualization is controlled solely by the position and orientation of a tracked applicator. This enables a direct interaction with the map display without interruption of the intervention. Based on our requirement analysis, we conducted a pilot study with eleven participants and an interactive user study with six domain experts to assess the task completion time, error rate, visual parameters and the usefulness of the animation. The outcome of our pilot study shows that our map display facilitates significantly faster decision making (11.8 s vs. 40.9 s) and significantly fewer false assessments of structures at risk (7.4 % vs. 10.3 %) compared to a currently employed 3D visualization. Furthermore, the animation supports timely perception of the course and depth of upcoming blood vessels, and helps to detect possible areas at risk along the path in advance. Hence, the obtained results demonstrate that our proposed interactive map displays exhibit potential to improve the outcome of navigated liver interventions.
