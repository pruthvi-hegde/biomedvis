A Survey on Visualizing Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Data. Data from Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Imaging (MRSI) contains signals about biomarkers concentrations, which are used to achieve new knowledge about biochemical processes. These support doctors in identifying and treat diseases as well as better defining regions of interest. In clinical environment, the lack of appropriate methods and tools to visualize MRSI has made this imaging technique information hard to interpret and include in treatment planning workflows. This paper is doing a review on how MRSI data is analysed in a medical environment as well as new approaches from the rendering and visual analytics areas. We conclude that this topic will be under the spotlight in the coming years, as current research is still facing many challenges on which the visualization community can actively contribute to.
