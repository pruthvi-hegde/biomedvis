Bone Fracture and Lesion Assessment using Shape-Adaptive Unfolding. The assessment of rib bone fractures and lesions consists of many images that have to be thoroughly inspected slice-by-slice and rib-by-rib. Existing visualization methods, such as curved planar reformation (CPR), reduce the number of images to inspect and, in turn, the time spent per case. However, this task remains time-consuming and exhausting. In this paper, we propose a novel rib unfolding strategy that considers the cross-sectional shape of each rib individually and independently. This leads to shape-adaptive slices through the ribs. By aggregating these slices into a single image, we support radiologists with a concise overview visualization of the entire rib cage for fracture and lesion assessment. We present results of our approach along different cases of rib and spinal fractures as well as lesions. To assess the applicability of our method, we separately evaluated the segmentation (with 954 data sets) and the visualization (with two clinical coaches).
