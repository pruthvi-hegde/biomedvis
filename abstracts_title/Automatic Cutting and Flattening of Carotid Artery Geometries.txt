Automatic Cutting and Flattening of Carotid Artery Geometries. We propose a novel method to cut and flatten vascular geometry that results in an intuitive mapping between the 3D and 2D domains. Our approach is fully automatic, and the sole input is the vessel geometry. We aim to simplify parameter analysis on vessel walls for research on vascular disease and computational hemodynamics. We present a use case for the flattening to aid efforts in investigating the pathophysiology of carotid stenoses (vessel constrictions that are a root cause of stroke). To achieve an intuitive mapping, we introduce the notion of natural vessel cuts. They remain on one side of vessel branches, meaning they adhere to the longitudinal direction and thus result in a comprehensible unfolding of the geometry. Vessel branches and endpoints are automatically detected, and a 2D layout configuration is found that retains the original branch layout. We employ a quasi-isometric surface parameterization to map the geometry to the 2D domain as a single patch. The flattened depiction resolves the need for tedious 3D interaction as the whole surface is visible at once.We found this overview particularly beneficial for exploring temporally resolved parameters.
