Visual Assessment of Vascular Torsion using Ellipse Fitting. Blood vessels are well explored and researched in medicine and visualization. However, the investigation of vascular torsion has yet been unexplored. In order to understand the development and current state of a single blood vessel or even multiple connected ones, properties of vascular structures have to be analyzed. In this paper we assess the torsion of blood vessels in order to better understand their morphology. The aim of this work is to quantitatively gauge blood vessels by using an automated method that assumes an elliptical blood vessel model. This facilitates using state-of-the-art ellipse fitting algorithms from industrial measuring standards. In order to remove outliers, we propose a self-correcting iterative refitting of ellipses using neighboring information. The torsion information is visually conveyed by connecting the major and minor points of adjacent ellipses. Our final visualization comprises a visual representation of the blood vessel including four bands to outline the torsion.
