Design Considerations for Immersive Analytics of Bird Movements Obtained by Miniaturised GPS Sensors. Recent advances in miniaturising sensor tags allow to obtain high-resolution bird trajectories, presenting an opportunity for immersive close-up observation of individual and group behaviour in mid-air. The combination of geographical, environmental, and movement data is well suited for investigation in immersive analytics environments. We explore the benefits and requirements of a wide range of such environments, and illustrate a multi-platform immersive analytics solution, based on a tiled 3D display wall and head-mounted displays (Google Cardboard, HTC Vive and Microsoft Hololens). Tailored to biologists studying bird movement data, the immersive environment provides a novel interactive mode to explore the geolocational time-series data. This paper aims to inform the 3D visualisation research community about design considerations obtained from a real world data set in different 3D immersive environments. This work also contributes to ongoing research efforts to promote better understanding of bird migration and the associated environmental factors at the planet-level scale, thereby capturing the public awareness of environmental issues.
