A Haptics-enabled Simulator for Transperineal Ultrasound-Guided Biopsy. We present the development of a transperineal prostate biopsy, with high fidelity haptic feedback. We describe our current prototype, which is using physical props and a Geomagic Touch. In addition, we discuss a method for collecting in vitro axial needle forces, for programming haptic feedback, along with implemented an forthcoming features such as a display of 2D ultrasonic images for targeting, biopsy needle bending, prostate bleeding and calcification. Our ultimate goal is to provide an affordable high-fidelity simulation by integrating contemporary off-the-shelf technology components.
