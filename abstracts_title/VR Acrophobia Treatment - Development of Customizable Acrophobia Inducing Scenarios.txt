VR Acrophobia Treatment - Development of Customizable Acrophobia Inducing Scenarios. Specific phobias are among the most common mental diseases, affecting the lives of millions of people. Yet, many cases remain untreated and even undiagnosed, partly due to entry barriers such as waiting times and inconvenience of therapy. To improve the therapeutic options and convenience for the treatment of specific phobias, we implemented a virtual reality application for treating acrophobia (fear of heights) with in-virtuo exposure therapy. Our concept is based on principles from psychology and interaction design. This concept is then implemented using the game engine Unity and Oculus Rift headset as a target device for VR display. Our application has a wide range of customization options, which enables it to be personalized to individual patients. In addition, a number of motivational methods are integrated, which are intended to increase patient motivation, as motivation is essential for a successful therapy.
