Ontology-Based Visualization of Hierarchical Neuroanatomical Structures. This work presents a method for generating intuitive visualizations for high-level user queries to an hierarchical surface-based neuroanatomical atlas. We combine a spreading activation approach for computing focus and context in an ontology with a specific level-of-detail strategy for hierarchical structures. We demonstrate our method on an atlas of the bee brain.
