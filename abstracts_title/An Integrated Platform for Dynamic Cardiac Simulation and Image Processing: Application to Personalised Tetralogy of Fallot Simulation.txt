An Integrated Platform for Dynamic Cardiac Simulation and Image Processing: Application to Personalised Tetralogy of Fallot Simulation. Processing and visualisation of dynamic data is still a common challenge in medical imaging, especially as for many applications there is an increasing amount of clinical data as well as generated data, such as in cardiac modelling. In this context, there is a strong need for software that can deal with dynamic data of different kinds (i.e. images, meshes, signals, etc.). In this paper we propose a platform that aims at helping researchers and clinicians to visualise and process such dynamic data, as well as evaluate simulation results. To illustrate this platform we chose to follow a concrete clinical application, the personalised simulation of the Tetralogy of Fallot. We show that the software provides the user with a significant help in the assessment and processing of the 3D+t raw data, as well as an adapted framework for visualisation and evaluation of various dynamic simulation results.
