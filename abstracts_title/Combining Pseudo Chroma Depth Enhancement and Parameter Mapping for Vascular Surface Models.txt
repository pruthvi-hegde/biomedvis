Combining Pseudo Chroma Depth Enhancement and Parameter Mapping for Vascular Surface Models. The presence of depth cues in a visualization can be a great aid in understanding the structure and topology of a vessel tree. Pseudo Chromadepth is a well-known technique for enhancing depth perception in vascular 3D models. Since it strongly relies on the color channel to convey its depth cues, it is traditionally not suited for combined visualizations comprising color-encoded surface parameters. In this paper, we present and evaluate the use of a modified form of Pseudo Chromadepth that supports displaying additional surface parameters using the color channel while still increasing depth perception. This technique has been designed for the visualization of cerebral aneurysm models. We have combined a discretized color scale to visualize the surface parameter with the Pseudo Chromadepth color scale to convey depth using a Fresnel-inspired blending mask. To evaluate our approach, we have conducted two consecutive studies. The first was performed with 104 participants from the general public and the second with eleven experts in the fields of medical engineering and flow simulation. These studies show that Pseudo Chromadepth can be used in conjunction with color-encoded surface attributes to support depth perception as long as the color scale is chosen appropriately.
