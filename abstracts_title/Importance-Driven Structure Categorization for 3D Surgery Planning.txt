Importance-Driven Structure Categorization for 3D Surgery Planning. We present an importance-driven categorization approach to automatically gather all currently required structures for the surgery planning process. Therefore, we analyzed common demands for tumor intervention planning and integrated domain knowledge to enable a determination of the relevant structures for various surgical questions. The categorization of structures in focus, focus-relevant and context is defined and initiated by the question. Our method uses the structure's specific meta data and geometric information to determine an importance value for each structure automatically. This importance value encodes the structure's priority for the current question and defines the structure's category. Furthermore, this value can be used to define a structure-specific visual style to generate expressive 3D surgery planning visualizations.
